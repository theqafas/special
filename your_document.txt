Preface
1.
National Cadet Corps (NCC) came into existence on 15 July 1948 under an Act of
Parliament. Over the years, NCC has spread its activities and values across the length and breath
of the country, in schools and colleges in almost all the districts of India. It has attracted millions
of young boys and girls to the very ethos espoused by its motto “Unity and Discipline” and moulded
them into disciplined and responsible citizens of the country. NCC has attained an enviable brand
value for itself in the Young India’s mind space.
2.
National Cadet Corps (NCC) aims at character building and leadership in all walks of life
and promotes the spirit of patriotism and National Integration among the youth of the country.
Towards this end, it runs a multifaceted training, varied in content, style and processes with added
emphasis on practical training, outdoor training and training as a community.

3.
With the dawn of Third Millennia, there have been rapid strides in technology,
information, social and economic fields bringing in a paradigm shift in learning field too, NCC
being no exception. A need was felt to change with times. NCC has introduced its New Training
Philosophy, catering to all the new changes and developments taking place in Indian Society. It has
streamlined and completely overhauled its training objectives, syllabus, methodology etc thus
making it in sync with times. Subjects like National Integration, Personality Development and Life
skills, Social Awareness etc have also been given prominent thrust.
4.
Air wing specialized syllabus has been designed to generate interest among students
about the defence forces and Indian Air Force in particular.

5.
The syllabus has been revised to make it cadet friendly, colourful, visually appealing with
large number of photographs, charts, pictures etc. It is hoped that this will facilitate better
assimilation and increased interest among the cadets.

DEVELOPMENT OF AVIATION (GSK-8)

C

K

The idea of human flight has engaged the thought of
many men since the beginning of history. Tracing the
evolution of flight, one gets into a world of myths,
religious beliefs and legends, when some of form of
flying was visualized in the encounter and affairs of
ancient life. There are the Vimanas of flying chariots in
Indian mythology, the winged deities from Egypt and
Assyria, the magic carpet from Arabia, the winged
Ancient Greek myth of Ikaros, pictured here,
horse Pegasus and winged cap and heals of Hermes in who attempted to fly..
Roman and Greek mythology. Mythologies aside, the
first scientific venture in aviation were the tentative steps made in the fourth century B.C
in China that eventually led to invention of the kite by the sixth century B.C, kites had
found their way in military applications.

C

G

In 1890 LILIENTHAL in Germany started riding the air in gliders and it was his example,
which fired the imagination of Wright brothers in America and turned their attention to
solving the practical problems of aviation .The Balloon was joined by the parachute in
1797 when the French man, GARAERIN made the first attempt at PARIS. In 1852
the stream driven Airship became feasible, and also the light pressure ship of SANTOS
and DUMONT.

N

C

The power airplane took ten years (1895-1905) to emerge from the Glider, which was
perfected by the Wright Brothers. In 1906 Wright Flyer 111 emerged which could be
banked, turned, circled and flown with ease and which could comfortably stay in the air
for more than half an hour at a time.

R

.ARCHAIC ORIGINS

AI

Stories of people attempting to fly can be found throughout
various ancient cultures. In Greek mythology there is the
legend of Daedalus and Icarus, the father and son who
created wings by combining feathers and wax. The story may
have ended in tragedy, but it showed that men have always
wanted to fly. Similar stories can be found in India, China and
Europe.In 852 AD, Armen Firman of Spain covered his body
with feathers and created wing-like garments that he attached
to his arms. He then proceeded to jump from a tower. Although
his attempt was unsuccessful, the garments slowed his
descent, allowing him to survive with only minor injuries.Kites,
which had been invented in China sometime in the 5th century,
are known as the first aircraft made by man. Man-lifting
kites where were also utilized in China and Japan for military
and punishment purposes. China is also credited with inventing hot air balloons (3rd

24

century BC) and rotor wings (400 BC).The Renaissance in Europe, from the 14th to
17th century, witnessed a creative explosion in architecture, art, music, politics and
science. Famous Renaissance artist and inventor Leonardo da Vinci developed the
early drafts for a rational aircraft. Among his inventions were the parachute and the
aerial screw. While his ideas were not scientifically sound, they were at least
reasonable.The age of modern aviation began during the 1700s, and came to embody
to main categories: lighter-than-air aviation and heavier-than-air aviation.
LIGHTER THAN AIR AVIATION

This type of aviation mainly involved balloons
and airships. On June 4, 1783, brothers
Joseph-Michel
and Jacques-Étienne
Montgolfier exhibited their unmanned hot air
balloon, which flew over Annonay, France. By
August 27 of the same year, brothers AnneJean and Nicolas-Louis Robert, along with
Jacques Charles, flew their unmanned
hydrogen-filled balloon over Champ de Mars,
Paris.On October 19, the Montgolfier brothers
sent up a manned flight with a tethered hot air
balloon piloted by Giroud de Villette, JeanBaptiste Réveillon and Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier. Then, on November 21, the
brothers launched their first untethered flight with Pilâtre de Rozier and François
d’Arlandes onboard. The balloon was lifted by hot air from a wood fire and flew a total of
nine kilometers in 25 minutes. Despite having enough fuel to fly for a longer duration,
the two aeronauts had to land because the firewood’s embers began to burn the fabric.
Hot air balloons suffer from a disadvantage, however lack of maneuverability. The
invention of airships, otherwise known as dirigibles or zeppelins, solved this issue.
Dirigibles derive lift from hydrogen or helium gas instead of from heat. These airships
were the first to carry passengers over long distances. Perhaps the most famous were
the dirigibles manufactured by German airship company Luftschiffbau Zeppelin Gmbh.
Airships are classified into three categories:
Non-rigid – Also known as blimps, they lack a solid wood or metal framework.
They basically consist of envelopes filled with gas, with a small gondola attached
below.
Semi-rigid – An airship with a solid supporting structure that only runs on the
bottom part of the ship’s interior.

Rigid – These airships have a full internal framework, usually constructed from
wood or some type of metal, covered with an envelope. One or more gasbags
inside provide lift.
The age of lighter-than-air aviation waned with the development of better airplane
designs. On May 6, 1937, the zeppelin Hindenburg burst into flames and crashed to the

THE ERA OF DIGITAL AVIATION
With the emphasis during the modern era on adopting digital or computerized
techniques, the aviation industry has really taken off. During the 1970s, computer-aided
design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) software enabled the creation of
better aircraft designs. Computer simulations have also led to the discovery of better
materials for creating lighter and stronger airplanes. Digital systems have found their
way inside the modern aircraft, rendering most mechanical and analogue instruments
obsolete. An example of this is the “glass cockpit” employing LCD screens instead of
the mechanical gauges and dials.

The first Indian aviator both pilot and
aircraft constructor was Prof Venketa
Subba Setty of Mysore who was a
remarkable person, being the first Indian to
fly, and as a pioneer in aeronautical
engineer, to design, build and fly an aircraft.
This was on 16 June 1912, while he was with
A.V Roe and CO (Avro) at Brooklands in the
Manchester area of England. VS Setty had
joined A.V Roe on 08 May 1911 as a time keeper and within some weeks on 27 May
1911 along with another Indian SV Sippe began to practice for flight in a Gnome
powered Farman pusher biplane. Within some months he had rolled (flown) in a 35 H.P
Viale engined Avro type D (No.6). On 27 September 1911, Setty had his first flying
incident ending up in the sewage farm adjacent to Brooklands which happened
frequently to early aviators and Setty ended up there again on 21 February 1912
while flying on Avro type B; but was uninjured. Prof Setty’s interests included
automobiles, he participated in car races in the U.K and first Indian on a motor cycle
born in 1879, this pioneer of aviation only lived till the age of 39, passing away in
1918. There was barely any aviation activity in India during years of the Great War.
However a central flying school had been set up in Sitapur on 1 October 1915 under
the control of Army HQ with the object of Officers gaining experience under Indian
conditions, with some five air planes in service. Individual Indian aviator had, however
engaged themselves in aviation pursuits when they managed to enlist in the
Royal Flying Course. Lt Hardeep Singh Malik, Lt Indra Lal Roy, D.F.C and Lt SG
Welingkar, M.C, where amongst the Indian in the RFC. Although the First World War
had disrupted the development of aviation in India, it had given an opportunity for these
young pilots to distinguish themselves. Lt Indra Lal Roy was one of the first Indian to
receive the king’s commission at the age of 18. He was with No.56 Squadron RFC on
the western front and No 40 Squadron during July 1918 shooting down several
German fighters. Sardar Hardeep Singh Malik who was later to be Indian Ambassador
to Paris served in both the RFC and RAF. He had joined the RFC in April 1917, later
was in operation with No.28 Squadron and flew Sopwith Camels as a fighter pilot. In
1913 there was about five air machines in India. There was no pilot apart from a few

Civil aviation in India picked up soon when intercontinental flights started
between Europe and India. As part of British Empire the initiative for development of
the aviation, civil and military in India was naturally the prerogative of the
British government. One of Britan’s immediate objectives was to have independent air
route to India. With Seften Brancker being director
of civil aviation during this period, India naturally
became the focus point in British aviation plans.
Seften
Brancker’s
ambitious
plans
for
intercontinental air links were realized when, on
17 March 1925, he flew aboard a D.H 50 from
Croyvon terminal in London to Rangoon in Burma
and returned back, thereby completing an 8000
miles air trip to India and back. This adventures
expedition laid the foundation for intercontinental
civil air services. However the first proving flight of Officers of ‘A’ Flight IAF at Drigh Road

established in 1927 as an integral part of the
department of industries and labour, Lt Col Shelmderdine being appointed as the first
director of civil aviation. His first priority was the creation of chain of aerodromes with
good permanent hangars incorporating workshops and offices on the Karachi-Calcutta
and Karachi-Southern India routes. Another vital task to be accomplished was
establishing a wireless communication network and direction finding station, comprising
point to point communication on the entire route. Shelmderdine spent considerable time
in organizing the state owned India state air services to operate the Indian sector of the
entire route between London and Far East. He was also the person pushing for
establishing flying clubs across the country as also the aero club of India.
Among the early aviators of India, there was an elite class of incredibly talented flying
enthusiastic who contributed majorly to the growth and sustenance of aviation in India.
There were A.M Engineer, popularly known as ASPY, Man Mohan Singh and JRD
Tata. Born on 15 December 1912, A.M Engineer was, at 17 the youngest Indian pilot of
the time. He won the Aga Khan Trophy being the first Indian to fly solo from England to
India in a Gypsy Moth. Later, he trained at RAF Cranwel where he was adjudged the
best all-round cadet was commissioned in to A Flight of IAF, and flew the Wapitis in the
North Western frontier province. No 1 Squadron was formed in July 1938, Engineer
was appointed the Flight Commander and flew operations in North Waziristan in May
1939. A flight under Engineer’s command carried out 403 hours of flying operation, a
feat which was acknowledged as remarkable in view of the small number of aircraft and
crew available.

In its early years expansion of IAF was rather slow. In Sep,
1939 it consisted of only one squadron with a complement of
16 officers and 144 airmen. During World War II the
increasing commitments of the RAF in Europe and the
impact of Japanese invasion in south-east Asia accelerated
the pace of progress.

At the end of March 1941, No.1 Squadron and 3 CDFs gave up their Wapitis which
were requisitioned to equip No.2 Squadron raised at Peshawar in the following
months and were issued instead with Armstrong Withworth Atlanta transport, used to
patrol the Sunder bans Delta area south of Calcutta. No.2 CDF had meanwhile
received requisitioned D.H.89 Dragon Rapides for convoy and coastal patrol, while
No.5 CDF took on strength a single D.H.86 which it used for convoy and patrol the
waters of Cape Comorin and the Malabar Coast. By Oct 1943, the strength rose to 8 full
squadrons with 911 officers and 40146 airmen. By the end of war two more squadrons
were added to it. The squadrons were equipped with variety of aircrafts, viz., Lysander,
Wapiti, Audax, Hurricane, Vengeance and Spitfire.

THE INDIAN AIR FORCE TODAY

AI

The Indian Air Force (IAF) today, having completed the Platinum Jubilee of dedicated
service to the nation, is a modern, technology-intensive force distinguished by its
commitment to excellence and professionalism. Keeping pace with the demands of
contemporary advancements, the IAF continues to modernise in a phased manner and
today it stands as a credible air power counted amongst the fore-most professional
services in the world.
The primacy of Air Power will be a decisive factor in shaping the outcome of future
conflicts. In line with this dictum, the Indian Air Force (IAF) has developed into a major
'Component of National Power', which can be applied quickly and decisively. The IAF
has reoriented itself to a multi-role capability of platforms and equipment, along with
multi-skill capability of personnel. The rapid economic growth of the country dictates the
need to protect our security interests extending from the Persian Gulf to the Straits of
Malacca. Over the years the IAF has grown from a tactical force to one with

31

transoceanic reach. The strategic reach emerges from induction of Force Multipliers like
Flight Refuelling Aircraft (FRA), Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) and credible strategic
lift capabilities. There is emphasis on acquiring best of technology through acquisitions
or upgradation, be it aircraft, systems, precision missiles or net centricity.

but significant distinction between nonviolence and cowardice. Hence, when the
Pakistan hordes descended on us on the evening of 3 rd

December, we were left with no option but to give a fitting
reply. This is what precisely our defence forces did. In the
process the enemy’s war machinery was dealt crippling
blows. What is more, our armed forces in conjunction with
the Mukti Bahini ended the dark night of oppression and
brutality in East Bengal and ushered in the new state of
Bangladesh. All this was achieved in a remarkably short
period of fourteen days. In fact the unconditional surrender by the enemy’s one lakh
armed forces is unprecedented.
AGGRESSION BY PAKISTAN

Darkness had just fallen on the evening of 3rd
December 1971 when air raid alert was sounded
at 6 PM in most of the cities in India. With the
sounding of siren all lights went off. Everyone
including the President, the Cabinet Ministers, the
Member of Parliament, the newsmen was taken
unaware. The briefing officer told newsmen that
the raid alert was a genuine one. Soon people
realised the seriousness of the situation. The
street lights were never switched ON. The cities
were plunged into darkness. The A.I.R then revealed the unfortunate incident of
unprovoked aggression by Pakistan.
The military junta of Pakistan seem to have chosen the hour of attack with some
deliberation and care. The Prime Minister Smt Indira Gandhi was away from New Delhi
on days visit to Calcutta, where she had just finished speaking to a large gathering
on the Pakistani threat to India’s security and the liberation struggle in the Bangladesh.
The Defence Minister, Shri Jagjivan Ram was at Patna. The Finance Minister YE
Chavan left the capital minutes before the Pakistani attack was launched.
The Pakistani Air Force and ground troops following the Israeli type pre-emptive strike
had launched a massive attack on the Western front stretching from Jammu & Kashmir
to Rajasthan. Pakistani Radio went on the air alleging an Indian attack, when the
Pakistani planes were bombing our air fields in sneak raids. Pakistan’s friend,

34

philosopher and guide Peking’s New China News Agency also broadcasted similar
allegations.
In addition to air raids by the Pakistani Air Force the ground forces also launched a
massive attack on our border posts.

The professional standards, capability and flexibility of the much expanded Service
were soon to be put to the acid test. At 1449
hours, four Pakistani Sabres strafed Indian
and Mukti Bahini positions in the Chowgacha
Mor area, and 10 minutes later, while engaged
on a third strafing run, the Sabres were
intercepted by four Gnats from No. 22 Sqn, a
detachment of which was operating from Dum
Dum Airport, Calcutta. During the ensuing
melee, three of the Sabres were shot down, all
Gnats returning to base unscathed. The first
blood of a new Indo-Pakistan air war had been drawn. Other encounters were to follow
over the next 10 days, within both Indian and Pakistani airspace, before full-scale war
began on 3 December. Pre-emptive strikes were launched by the Pakistan Air Force
against IAF bases at Srinagar, Amritsar and Pathankot, followed by attacks on Ambala,
Agra, Jodhpur, Uttarlai, Avantipur, Faridkot, Halwara and Sirsa. Apart from IAF bases,
the PAF attacked railway stations, Indian armour concentrations and other targets. In
response and during the ensuing two weeks, the IAF carried out some 4,000 sorties in
the West from major and forward bases in Jammu, Kashmir, Punjab and Rajasthan,
while, in the East, a further 1,978 sorties were flown.

AI

Throughout the conflict, in which Indian strategy was to maintain basically defensive
postures on the western and northern fronts whilst placing emphasis on a lightning
campaign in the east, the IAF established a highly credible serviceability rate which
exceeded 80 per cent. Mission emphasis throughout was on interdiction. In the West
the IAF's primary tasks were disruption of enemy communications, the destruction of
fuel and ammunition reserves, and the prevention of any ground force concentrations so
that no major offensive could be mounted against India while Indian forces were
primarily engaged in the East. On the Eastern front, the Indian forces launched a
sophisticated campaign which included rapid-moving infantry and armour advancing
from three directions, airborne and heliborne assaults, missile bombardments from
ships and an amphibious landing, the IAF's task being primarily direct support of the
ground forces. In a classic air action in the Western desert, four Hunters of the OCU,
detachment at Jaisalmer destroyed an entire armoured regiment at Longewala, literally
stopping the enemy offensive in its tracks.
The IAF had good reason for satisfaction with its showing during the December 1971
conflict. Although Pakistan had initiated the war with pre-emptive air strikes against

35

K

major forward air bases, the IAF rapidly gained the initiative and had thereafter
dominated the skies over both fronts. Admittedly, there had to be war losses but the IAF
flew many more sorties than its opponent with interdiction missions predominating, and
the bulk of the Service's attrition was the result of intensive anti-aircraft fire; in aerial
combat, the IAF proved its superiority in no uncertain manner. First round had gone to
the Gnats, again, but its later compatriots, the MiG-21s, were to shortly demonstrate the
superiority of this supersonic fighter, flown by professionals. Six squadrons of MiG21FLs were part of the IAF's order-of battle, participating in operations both in the
Eastern and Western Sectors. Three MiG-21 squadrons, operating from Gauhati and
Tezpur,took part in counter-air, escort and close air support tasks during the blitzkrieg
action in Bangladesh. That the MiG-21 was highly effective in short range, precision
attacks was amply demonstrated during the attacks with 500 kg bombs on the PAF's air
bases at Tezgaon and Kurmitola, while pin point 57 mm rocket attacks were carried out
against key command centres in the capital Dacca itself.

C

It was in the Western theatre that the MiG-21 was employed in its primary task, that of
air defence, escort and interception. Deployed at all the major air bases, from Pathankot
in the north to Jamnagar in the South Western area, the MiG-21FLs mounted hundreds
of combat air patrol sorties over Vital Points (VP) and Vital Areas (VA), flew escort
missions for bombers and strike fighters and were continuously scrambled to intercept
hostile intruders. The MiG-21 finally met its original adversary, the F- 104 Starfighter, in
air combat over the Subcontinent during the December 1971 conflict and in all four
recorded cases of classic dog fights, the MiG-21s outclassed and out fought the F104s. The first aerial victory was on 12 December 1971, when MiG-21FLs of No. 47
Squadron shot down a PAF F-104 over the Gulf of Kutch and this was followed by three
more victories in quick succession on 17 December, when MiG-21FLs of No. 29
Squadron escorting HF-24 Maruts, shot down intercepting F-104s near Uttarlai in the
Rajasthan desert in gun-missile encounters, while a third F-104, on an intruding
mission, was shot down by another MiG 21FL of No.29 Squadron.

The December 1971 war also meant the gaining of India's highest award for gallantry to
the IAF. Flying Officer Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon, flying Gnats with No. 18 Squadron from
Srinagar, was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra. Notwithstanding the
successful campaign of December 1971 which created both history and geography, the
Indian Air Force had lessons to draw from subsequent analyses of the conflict, although
for the most part, these lessons dictated refinement rather than any fundamental
change.

Sunday Times, London reported “one result of India’s victory would be the
collapse of military rule and the triumph of democracy. It is no paradox therefore, to see
that India is fighting to bring freedom to all the people of the sub-continent, who are
in the eye of God, one people”.
RECOGNITION OF BANGLA DESH BY INDIA

The East Pakistan Rifles and East Bengal Regiment became the Mukti Fauj and later
the Mukti Bahini which was joined by thousands of young East Bengal’s
determined to sacrifice their lives for freedom. Government of Bangla Desh and
Government of India unanimously decided to grant recognition to the ‘Gana Prajatantra
Bangladesh’. The father of the new state became Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, Dhaka
became the capital.
SUMMARY
In fact the suppression by military junta of Pakistan carried on in Bangladesh and the
exemplary courage displayed by the people of Bangladesh in facing such situation is
not a secret. It has been recorded in the world press. No one can say that India’s

decision to recognise Bangladesh is based on emotions and not based on present and
future realities. It can also not be said to be a hasty step for recognition was accorded
only after Pakistan was unable to exercise any control over the people of Bangladesh.
“The will of the nation substantially expressed”. The act of according of recognition to
Bangladesh is to admit realities, and since history has such precedence, when an
emerging colony was accorded independence, recognition Bangladesh, which has been
treated as a colony and which was emerged successfully from its parent country,
cannot be condemned by any nation. Later on National flag and National song sung by

OPERATION SAFED SAGAR (AC-2)
Operation Safed Sagar was the codename assigned to the Indian Air Force's strike
to support the Ground troops during Operation Vijay that was aimed to flush out
Regular and Irregular troops of the Pakistani Army from vacated Indian Positions in the
Kargil sector along the Line of Control. It was the first large scale use of air power in the
Jammu and Kashmir region since the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.

G

C

Initial infiltrations were noticed in Kargil in early May,
1999. Because of the extreme winter weather in
Kashmir, it was common practice for the Indian and
Pakistan Army to abandon forward posts and reoccupy
them in the spring. That particular spring, the Pakistan
Army reoccupied the forward posts before the
scheduled time not only theirs but also which belonged
to India, in a bid to capture Kashmir.

By the second week of May, an ambush on an Indian army patrol acting on a tip- off by
a local shepherd in the Batalik sector led to the exposure of the infiltration. Initially with
little knowledge of the nature or extent of the encroachment, the Indian troops in the
area initially claimed that they would evict them within a few days. However, soon
reports of infiltration elsewhere along the LoC made it clear that the entire plan of attack
was on a much bigger scale. India responded with Operation Vijay, a mobilization
of
200,000 Indian troops. However, because of the nature of the terrain, division and
corps operations could not be mounted; the scale of most fighting was at the regimental
or battalion level. In effect, two divisions of the Indian Army numbering 20,000, along
with several thousand from the Paramilitary forces of India and the Air force were
deployed in the conflict zone. the Indian Army moved into the region in full force. Soon,
the intruders were found to be well entrenched and while artillery attacks had produced
results in certain areas, more remote ones needed the help of the Air force.
Air Operations

The Indian Air Force (IAF) was first approached to provide air support on 11 May with
the use of helicopters. On 21 May a Canberra on a
reconnaissance mission was hit by ground fire. The
flight was however, recovered safely, and returned to
base on one engine. On 25 May, the Cabinet
Committee on Security authorized the IAF to mount
attacks on the infiltrators without crossing the LoC.
Initial indications from the government to the IAF was
to operate only Attack helicopters. However, the Chief

39

of Air Staff put forth the argument that in order to create a suitable environment for the
helicopters, fighter action was required. On 26 May, the go-ahead was given and
the IAF started its strike role. Flying from the Indian airfields of Srinagar, Avantipur and
Adampur, ground attack aircraft MiG-21s, MiG-23s, MiG-27s, Jaguars and the
Mirage 2000 struck insurgent positions.
The first strikes were launched on the 26 May, when the Indian Air Force struck
infiltrator positions with fighter aircraft and helicopter gunships. The initial strikes saw
MiG-27s carrying out offensive sorties, with MiG-21s and (later) MiG-29s providing
fighter cover. Mi-17 gunships were also deployed in the Tololing sector. Srinagar Airport
was at this time closed to civilian air-traffic and dedicated to the Indian Air Force.

C

K

However, on 27 May, the first fatalities were suffered when a MiG-21 and a MiG-27
jets were shot down over Batalik Sector by Pakistan Army. The following day, a Mi-17
was lost- with the loss of all four of the crew- when it was hit by three Stinger
missiles while on an offensive sortie. These losses forced the Indian Air Force to
reassess its strategy. The helicopters were immediately withdrawn from offensive roles
as a measure against the man-portable missiles in possession of the infiltrators.

G

On 30 May, the Indian Air Force called into operation the Mirage 2000 which was
deemed the best aircraft capable of optimum performance under the conditions of highaltitude seen in the zone of conflict. Armed initially
with 250 kg "dumb" bombs, No.7 Squadron over
three days, struck infiltrator positions in Muntho
Dhalo, Tiger Hill and Point 4388 in the Drass Sector.
The strikes on Muntho Dhalo on 17 June also
destroyed logistics and re-supply capabilities of the
infiltrators in the Batalik Sector. Through the last
weeks of June, the Mirages, armed with LGBs as well
as with "dumbs", repeatedly struck the heavily
defended Tiger Hill.

AI

The choppers used were Mi-8 and the Mi-17. The transport planes were Avro, An-32
and IL-76. On May 27, the IAF had sent a MiG-27 on a photo reconnaissance mission
over the Indian side of the Line of Control in Kashmir Pilot ejected from MiG-27 after an
engine flameout due to Pakistani retaliation.
The next day the Air Force lost a MI-17 Helicopter to a shoulder fired missile near
Tololing, killing the crew of four. This resulted in a change in strategy and technology.
With the Israelis providing around 100 Laser-guided bomb kits to the Indian Military, the
Air force chose to make maximum use of this and retaliated with regular sorties on
Pakistani occupied bunkers. The aircraft operated at 10,000 meters AGL (33,000 feet
above sea level), well out of MANPADs range, leading to a drop in the accuracy rate of
the bombs. The low number of airstrips for take-off and landing of the flights also
constrained the efficiency of the attacks. Despite this, there were hundreds of sorties
on the intruders with no further material or personnel casualties enabling a gradual

40

takeover of the mountain posts by Indian troops. According to IAF the "air strikes
against the Pakistani infiltrators, supply camps and other targets yielded rich
dividends."

K

By July all the remaining intruders had withdrawn and the operation was ended, being
declared a success by the IAF in having achieved its primary objectives. However there
has also been criticism of the methods initially used and the type of planes being
unsuitable to the terrain that resulted in early losses. This is believed by many in the Air
force as coming as a wakeup call to upgrade the ageing fleet of craft (especially
the attack aircraft and helicopters) to better enable them to fight in the mountainous
region. But, in the context of the war and in light of the poor information available on the
infiltrations, the Indian Air Force was able to coordinate well with the Army and provide
air support to the recapture of most the posts before Pakistan decided to withdraw its
remaining troops.

C

Operation Safed Sagar, as the air operation in the Kargil area was called, was indeed a
milestone in the history of military aviation. This was the first time that air power
was employed in such an environment. Fighters as well as armed helicopters carried
out many hundreds of sorties against the armed intruders who had infiltrated into the
Indian Territory. The use of air power in this theatre was instrumental in accelerating the
end of the conflict to India’s advantage. IAF’s air strikes against enemy supply
camps and other targets yielded rich dividends. A noteworthy fact is that there was not
a single operation on ground that was not preceded by air strikes, each and every
action was a result of coordinated planning. The enemy was kept off the backs of the
Indian Army. In the area of interdiction of enemy supplies, the successful and
incessant attacks on the enemy’s logistic machines, over the weeks, culminated in a
serious degradation of the enemy’s ability to sustain them.

its capabilities may lie somewhere between these two extremes. A three-axis autopilot
adds control in the yaw axis and is not required in many small aircraft. Modern
autopilots use computer software to control the aircraft. The software reads the
aircraft's current position, and then controls a Flight Control System to guide the
aircraft. In such a system, besides classic flight controls, many autopilots incorporate
thrust control capabilities that can control throttles to optimize the airspeed, and move
fuel to different tanks to balance the aircraft in an optimal attitude in the air. Although
autopilots handle new or dangerous situations inflexibly, they generally fly an aircraft
with a lower fuel-consumption than a human pilot.
FLY BY WIRE

G

C

K

Fly-by-wire (FBW) is a system that replaces the conventional manual flight
controls of an aircraft with an electronic interface. The movements of flight controls
are converted as electronic signals transmitted through wires (hence the fly-by-wire
term), and flight control computers determine how to move the actuators at each
control surface to provide the ordered response. The fly-by-wire system also allows
automatic signals sent by the aircraft's computers to perform functions without the
pilot's input, as in systems that automatically help stabilize the aircraft.

N

C

C

Mechanical and hydro-mechanical flight control systems are relatively heavy and
require careful routing of flight control cables through the aircraft by systems of pulleys,
cranks, tension cables and hydraulic pipes. Both systems often require redundant
backup to deal with failures, which increases weight. The term "fly-by-wire" implies a
purely electrically-signaled control system. It is used in the general sense of computerconfigured controls, where a computer system is interposed between the operator and
the final control actuators or surfaces. This modifies the manual inputs of the pilot in
accordance with control parameters.

AI

Fly-by-optics

R

FURTHER DEVELOPMENT

Fly-by-optics is sometimes used instead of fly-by-wire because it can transfer data
at higher speeds the cables are just changed from electrical to fiber cables.
Power-by-wire
The power circuits power electrical or self-contained electro hydraulic actuators that are
controlled by the digital flight control computers. All benefits of digital fly-by-wire are
retained along with elimination of bulky and heavy hydraulic circuits.
Fly-by-wireless
Fly-by-wireless systems are very similar to fly-by-wire systems; however, instead of
using a wired protocol for the physical layer a wireless protocol is employed.

Mass. Unit - Kilogram (kg) - ‘The quantity of matter in a body.’ The mass of a body
is a measure of how difficult it is to start or stop, (“a body”, in this context, means a
substance. Any substance a gas, a liquid or a solid).
It is the mass per unit volume.

may be in magnitude or direction or in both. Thus a body moving along a circular path
at constant speed has acceleration.

Mass

Newton’s First Law of Motion. A body will continue to be in state of rest or of
uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. This property of
all bodies is called inertia and a body in such a state is said to be in Equilibrium.
Momentum. Unit - Mass x Velocity (kg-m/s) - ‘The quantity of motion
possessed by a body’. The tendency of a body to continue in motion after being
placed in motion.

60

Force.
Unit - Newton (N) -‘A push or a pull’. Thatwhich causes or tends to
cause a change in motion of a body.
Pressure.

Pressure is force per unit area.

Newton’s Second Law of Motion.
The rate of change of momentum of a body
is directly proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction of the
application of the said force.

67

An airfoil with a positive camber produces lift at zero angle of attack. With increased
angle of attack, lift increases in a roughly linear relation, called the slope of the lift
curve. At about 18 degrees this airfoil stalls, and lift falls off quickly beyond that. The
drop in lift can be explained by the action of the upper-surface boundary layer,
which separates and greatly thickens over the upper surface at and past the stall angle.
The thickened boundary layer's displacement thickness changes the airfoil's effective
shape, in particular it reduces its effective camber, which modifies the overall flow
field so as to reduce the circulation and the lift. The thicker boundary layer also
causes a large increase in pressure drag, so that the overall drag increases sharply
near and past the stall point.

C

G

C

K

Airfoil design is a major facet of aerodynamics. Various airfoils serve different flight
regimes. Asymmetric airfoils can generate lift at zero angle of attack, while a symmetric
airfoil may better suit frequent inverted flight as in an aerobatic airplane. In the region
of the ailerons and near a wingtip a symmetric airfoil can be used to increase the range
of angles of attack to avoid spin-stall. Thus a large range of angles can be used without
boundary layer separation. Subsonic airfoils have a round leading edge, which is
naturally insensitive to the angle of attack. The cross section is not strictly circular,
however: the radius of curvature is increased before the wing achieves maximum
thickness to minimize the chance of boundary layer separation. This elongates the wing
and moves the point of maximum thickness back from the leading edge.

R

N

C

Supersonic airfoils are much more angular in shape and can have a very sharp
leading edge, which is very sensitive to angle of attack. A supercritical airfoil has its
maximum thickness close to the leading edge to have a lot of length to slowly shock the
supersonic flow back to subsonic speeds. Generally such transonic airfoils and also the
supersonic airfoils have a low camber to reduce drag divergence. Modern aircraft wings
may have different airfoil sections along the wing span, each one optimized for the
conditions in each section of the wing.

AI

Movable high-lift devices, flaps and sometimes slats, are fitted to airfoils on
almost every aircraft. A trailing edge flap acts similarly to an aileron; however, it, as
opposed to an aileron, can be retracted partially into the wing if not used.
CONCLUSION

A Flying Cadet should have thorough knowledge of Aerofoil and types of
Aerofoils. It is the basic structure of ac which supports ac in air.

PRINCIPLE OF FLIGHT(PF-6)
FORCES ACTING ON AIRCRAFT
“It is possible to fly without motors, but not without knowledge and skill.”- Wilbur Wright
An Aircraft is considered to be in straight and level flight when it is flying at a constant
altitude and speed, maintaining lateral level and direction. Force acting on aircraft and
any given movement are Lift, Drag, Thrust and Weight.
FORCES ACTING ON AIRCRAFT

K

Lift is a positive force caused by the difference in air pressure under and above a wing.
The higher air pressure beneath a wing creates lift, and is affected by the shape of
the wing. Changing a wing's angle of attack affects the speed of the air flowing over the
wing and the amount of lift that the wing creates.

C

Weight is the force that causes objects to fall downwards. In flight, the force of weight is
countered by the forces of lift and thrust.

C

G

Thrust is the force that propels an object forward. An engine spinning a propeller or a
jet engine expelling hot air out the tailpipe are examples of thrust. In bats, thrust is
created by muscles making the wings flap.

AI

R

N

C

Drag is the resistance of the air to anything moving through it. Different wing
shapes greatly affect drag. Air divides smoothly around a wing's rounded leading edge,
and flows neatly off its tapered trailing edge...this is called streamlining.

The flight cadets should thoroughly be understanding the above basic concepts
of level flight for better understanding of aerodynamics.

PRINCIPLE OF FLIGHT (PF-7)
LIFT & DRAG
“What is chiefly needed is skill rather than machinery.”- Wilbur Wright
Lift and Drag are the most important components of aircraft in level flight. They act in
900 to each other. The Lift component of aircraft supports the aircraft in air whereas
the drag resist the air craft movement in air.

K

A fixed-wing aircraft during a stall may experience
buffeting or a change in attitude. Most aircraft are
designed to have a gradual stall with characteristics
that will warn the pilot and give the pilot time to react.
For example, an aircraft that does not buffet before the
stall may have an audible alarm or a stick shaker
installed to simulate the feel of a buffet by vibrating the
stick fore and aft. The "buffet margin" is, for a given set
of conditions, the amount of ‘g’, which can be
imposed for a given level of buffet. The critical angle
of attack in steady straight and level flight can be
attained only at low airspeed. Attempts to increase the
angle of attack at higher airspeeds can cause a high- speed stall or may merely cause
the aircraft to climb.

N

C

G

C

Stalling Speed.
Stalls depend only on angle of attack, not airspeed. Because a
correlation with airspeed exists, however, a "stall speed" is usually used in practice. It is
the speed below which the airplane cannot create enough lift to sustain its weight in
1g flight. In steady, unaccelerated (1g) flight, the faster an airplane goes, the less angle
of attack it needs to hold the airplane up (i.e., to produce lift equal to weight). As the
airplane slows down, it must increase angle of attack to create the same lift (equal to
weight). As the speed slows further, at some point the angle of attack will be equal
to the critical (stall) angle of attack. This speed is called the "stall speed". The angle of
attack cannot be increased to get more lift at this point and so slowing below the stall
speed will result in a descent. And, so, airspeed is often used as an indirect indicator of
approaching stall conditions. The stall speed will vary depending on the airplane's
weight, altitude, and configuration (flap setting, etc.)
CONCLUSION

AI

R

The cadets should have a deep understanding of the factors leading to Stall and the
stall characteristics so has to understand critical angle of attack, stalling speed and
recovery procedures.

to be aware about their own aircraft and the environment in which they operate before
they get airborne every time. The basic terminologies covered in this lesson can be said

in the aviation field. Therefore, the endeavor of all the pilots should be to gain full
knowledge about the aviation environment in which they operate to observe maximum

CONCLUSION

AI

R

The concept of airfields has changed considerably since the early days of flying. The
aircraft of yester years needed comparatively small, level grass areas. When these
airfields were built, the number of cross wind landing was reduced by building a
triangular pattern of three runways, the longest of which was usually in line with the
prevailing winds. But as the aircraft became faster, their landing and take-off runs
became longer and the airfields had to be enlarged to meet their ends. With faster
approach and landing speeds of aircraft, the lengths of runway became more important
factor than the wind direction. The modern tendency, therefore, is for operations to be
confined to one or at the most two runways on each airfield. The longest of these
runways is usually designed for instrument landings in bad weather and it is known as
instrument runway having full, lighting, radio, radar and instrument landing
facilities.

Rules Applicable to IFR Flights within Controlled Airspace. IFR flights shall
comply with the provisions of ATC instructions as specified in the general rules. The
cruising levels to be used by IFR flights for operation in controlled airspace shall be in
accordance with the system of cruising levels in use (as published by the DGCA for
India Airspace) except that the correlation of levels to track prescribed therein shall not
apply whenever otherwise specified in ATC clearance.

AI

Cruising Level of IFR Flights Outside Controlled Airspace. An IFR flight
operating in level cruising flight outside controlled airspace shall be flown at a cruising
level appropriate to its track as specified in the cruising levels in the Indian airspace
(except when below 3000 ft amsl).
Communication. An IFR flight operating within specified areas or along
specified routes outside controlled airspace shall maintain a listening out watch on the
appropriate radio frequency and establish two way communication as necessary, with
the ATS units providing flight information service / advisory service.
Position Reports. An IFR flight operating outside controlled airspace shall
comply with the following provisions
(a)

Submit a flight plan.

98

(b)
Maintain listening out watch on the appropriate radio frequency and
establish two way communication as necessary with the air traffic service units
providing flight information service and shall report position as specified (rules of
the Air- General).
RIGHT OF WAY RULE
The following are some of the basic rules laid down to reduce the risk of collision:
Right of way procedure: aircraft are to give way to each other in the
following orders:-

G

C

K

(i)
Aero planes
(ii)
Helicopters
(iii)
Airships
(iv)
Tug and glider combinations
(v)
Gliders
(vi)
Balloons
For example, aero planes give way to all other types of aircraft.

C

Converging. When two aircrafts are on the paths which cross, the aircraft which
has the other on its right is to give way.

C

Approaching Head On. When two aircrafts are approaching head on, each is to
alter heading to the right.

R

N

Overtaking. An aircraft overtaking another aircraft is to avoid the overtaking
aircraft by altering heading to the right, and is to keep clear until all risk of
collision is past. Sub para (a) does not apply to this rule. An aircraft is overtaking
another aircraft, when it is approaching from the rear at an angle of less than 70
degree to the fore and aft axis of the overtaken aircraft.

AI

Landing. Aircraft in the final stage of landing have the right of way over aircraft in
the air and on the ground.
Approaching to Land. The aircraft at the lower altitude on the approach has the
right of way; normally, however, as a matter of courtesy, captains of light
maneuverable aircraft give way for the heavier types in which the overshoot
procedure is involved.
Emergency landing. An aircraft seen, or known to be carrying out an
emergency landing has the right of way over all others. Every aircraft obliged by
the above rules to keep out of the way of another, is, if possible, to avoid passing
over a under the other or crossing ahead of it. The aircraft having the right of way
should normally maintain its heading and speed.

99

CIRCUIT RULES

C

MINIMUM ALTITUDES

K

The airfield circuit is the airspace extending to 3,000 ft. above airfield elevation, on a
radius of 18,000 ft. from the centre of the airfield. When flying in the circuit, a pilot is to:
(a) Keep a sharp look out for other aircraft in
the vicinity.
(b) Conform with or avoid the traffic pattern.
(c) Maintain a continuous listening watch on the
aerodrome R/T frequencies
and keep a sharp look out for any visual signals
which may be displayed.
(d) Obtain, by R/T or visual means,
authorization for any movements.

G

Except for taking off and landing, aircraft are not to be flown over built over areas, or
assemblies of people, etc. unless at an altitude that would enable them to be landed
clear in the event of an emergency landing being necessary. In all cases, their altitude
must be such that a minimum height of 2,000 ft. above the ground in maintained.

C

FLIGHT LEVEL SEPARATION SYSTEM

AI

R

N

C

For most small aircraft flying outside controlled airspace in good weather, the pilots are
responsible for maintaining a safe distance from other aircraft. This is the "see and be
seen" principle otherwise known as VFR or Visual Flight Rules. In this mode of
operation, a pilot must keep a continual watch for other aircraft in the sky.When flying
above 3,000 feet above ground level (AGL), the pilot must follow VFR cruising altitudes
given below (or east/west cruising altitudes).
Flying a magnetic course of 0° - 179°, fly at odd thousands plus 500 feet. For example,
3,500; 5,500; 7,500.Flying a magnetic course of 18° - 359°, fly at even thousands plus
500 feet. For example, 4,500; 6,500; 8,500.
For aircraft flying inside controlled airspace, pilots are still responsible for maintaining a
safe distance from other aircraft. They also must strictly follow IFR or Instrument Flight
Rules. In this mode of operation, pilots are flying under reduced visibility and must
depend on their instruments for additional guidance and information. Though rules of
separation vary depending on the airspace in which a aircraft is flying, in general, air
traffic controllers and pilots are required to maintain a horizontal distance of 5 nautical
miles between 2 aircraft flying at the same altitude. For altitudes at and below 29,000
feet, vertical separation must be maintained at a minimum 1,000 feet. For altitudes
above 29,000 feet vertical separation must be maintained at a minimum of
2,000 feet.

100

COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULES
The captain of an aircraft flying within the Indian union is to comply with rules of the air,
standard flying orders, and air traffic control regulations, except when:
(a)
He considers that compliance with them will jeopardize the safety of his
aircraft or when circumstances beyond his control compel a violation.
(b)
He is operating under the radar surveillance of a ground controlling
authority which is in contact with the A.T.C.C. in whose flight information region the
flight is taking place.

C

CONCLUSION

K

(c)
He is engaged in an operational flight on exercise for which
Special arrangements have been made. The captain of an aircraft using civil
aerodrome is to comply with the civil procedures in force at that aerodrome.

AI

R

G

Therefore it is mandatory for all the pilots to follow rules and regulations as given in the
relevant publications and amended thereof from time to time. In case the captain of an
aircraft experiencing circumstances which may lead to an unavoidable violation of
A.T.C. regulations he is to inform air traffic control by radio as soon as possible, so that
other aircraft may be safeguarded. The message is to be passed by the most direct
means to the controlling authority concerned and is to include call sign, aircraft type,
position, altitude, heading, airspeed, and relevant details of the violation. Air traffic
control is also to be informed as soon as regular observance of the regulations can be
resumed.

101

CIRCUIT PROCEDURES (AR-4)
A pattern for traffic movement has been established for use at all aerodromes. It is
called a traffic circuit and it expedites and separates airplanes using the same
aerodrome. It is the responsibility of every pilot, for safety and efficiency, to learn and
follow the proper traffic procedures when coming in to land at an aerodrome.
TRAFFIC CIRCUIT PROCEDURE
The following definitions apply to portions of the traffic circuit:
The upwind side is the area on the opposite side of the landing runway from the
downwind leg. Approach should be made into this area at or above circuit height.

C

K

The circuit joining crosswind is a corridor, lying within the airspace between the
centre of the landing runway and its upwind end, linking the upwind side and the
downwind leg.

C
N

AI

R

The base leg is a
flight path at right
angles to the direction
of
landing
and
sufficiently downwind
of the approach end
of the landing run-way
to permit at least a ¼
mile final approach
leg after completion of
a standard rate –one
turn to final approach.

C

G

The downwind leg is a flight path, opposite to the direction of landing, which is parallel
to and at a sufficient distance from the landing runway to permit a standard rate–one
turn to the base leg.

10.
The final
approach leg is a
flight path in the
direction lf landing, commencing at least ¼ mile from the runway threshold, wherein an
airplane is in line with the landing runway and descending towards the runway threshold

102

THE TRAFFIC CIRCUIT AT CONTROLLED AIRPORTS
The traffic circuit at controlled airport is similar to that at an un-controlled airport. It
consists of the cross wind leg, a downwind leg, a base leg and a final approach leg.
The principal difference is that you must established communication with the control
tower if flying at controlled airports.

C

G

C

K

You must establish and
maintain
radio
communication with the
control tower prior to
operating within the control
zone
served
by
an
operational control tower.
You must, therefore, call
the control tower on the
appropriate
frequency
prior to entering the control zone, give your identification and position and request
landing instructions. It is advisable to make this initial call about 5 minutes prior to
entering the zone .If the control zone is class B or class C air space ,the appropriate
clearance must be received from the controlling agency prior to entry into the classified
airspace.

AI

R

N

C

The tower controller will advise the runway in use, wind direction and speed, altimeter
setting and any other pertinent information and then will clear you to enter the circuit.
“Cleared to the Circuit” authorizes you to join the circuit on the downwind leg at
circuit height. If, because of your position in relation to the runway in use, it is necessary
to proceed crosswind prior to joining the circuit on the downwind leg, do so as
indicated in above diagram, approaching the active runway from the upwind side at a
point midway between each end of the runway staying clear of the approach and
departure paths of the active runway .When joining the circuit, you must conform as
closely as possible to the altitude, speed and size of the circuit being flown by other
traffic.
The airport controller may clear you to a straight in approach and in this instance; you
may join the traffic circuit on the final approach leg without having executed any other
portion of the circuit.
Once established in the traffic circuit, you should advise the tower of your position
(e.g.“Foxtrot Romeo Lima Tango is downwind”).The tower will then give you your
landing instructions .For example:
Tower: Piper Foxtrot Romeo Lima Tango you are number one. Give call on finals
Or

103

Tower: Piper Foxtrot Romeo Lima Tango you are number two.Follow Cessna 185
now on base leg.

K

You must have landing clearance prior to landing. Normally, the controller will clear
you to land as you turn on to final. If this is does not happen, it is your responsibility as
pilot to request landing clearance in sufficient time to accommodate the operating
characteristic of your airplane. If you do not receive landing clearance, you must pull up
and make another circuit. Even after landing clearance is given, the tower may advise
you to pull off and go around again if the situation on the runway becomes unsafe for
landing. If, after landing clearance is accepted, the situation is such that you, as pilot,
feel that there is a hazard to the safe operation of your flight you should advise ATC of
your intentions and go around again. If, for example, the cross wind component is too
much for the capabilities of your airplane, you may request another runway that is more
into the wind if one exists. Always advise ATC of your intentions.

C

C

G

C

After landing you should clear the runway without delay by continuing forward to the
nearest available taxi strip or turn off point. Continue to taxi until you have crossed the
taxi position hold line, or until you are at least 200ft from the runway. You must not exit
a runway onto another runway unless authorised by ATC to do so. If you have landed
beyond the last turn up point, proceed to the end of the runway, turn off and wait for
permission to taxi back to an intersection. Do not turn and taxi back against the
direction of landing traffic unless instructed to do so by the tower. When clear of the
active runway, the tower will advise you to switch to ground control who will give you
instructions and authorisation to taxi to the parking areas.

AI

R

N

At some of the larger controlled airports, more facilities than just the tower are available.
Runway and weather information is broadcast on the automatic terminal information
service (ATIS). Always listen to the ATIS before contacting the tower and then advice
the tower that you have the ATIS information. Extended area of class c airspace
surrounds some control zones and it is necessary to contact the area control before
contacting the tower. Always check the VTA chart if applicable for special procedures
that are in force at any airport at which you intend to land.
If you are intending to take off from a controlled airport, you must contact ground control
for taxi instructions before starting up towards the active runway. At some of the larger
airports, you must contact clearance delivery even before contacting ground control to
advice of your intentions. Ground control will give you instructions on how to proceed to
the active runway and will then advise you to switch to the tower frequency for take-off
instructions. When cleared for take-off, you shall acknowledge and take off without
delay. Once airborne, remain turned to the tower frequency during the time you are
operating within the control zone and preferably until you are at least ten miles outside
it. You do not require permission to change from the tower frequency, once you are
clear of the control zone and should not request release or report clear when there is
considerable frequency congestion.

The standard circuit begins with a roll down the runway until the aircraft rotates, a climb
out to traffic pattern altitude, a right or left climbing turn depending on making either
right hand or left hand circuits to 500 feet above ground level perpendicular to the
runway, continuing gaining altitude up to 700 feet AGL (as per ac manual), followed by
another right or left turn for a downwind leg parallel to the runway, maintaining 700 feet
AGL. During the downwind leg the pilot completes pre-landing checks and contacts the
control tower advising a full stop landing or a touch-and-go. After seeing the threshold
of the runway at 45 degrees behind him/her, the pilot makes another left or right turn
descending to 500 feet AGL. The pilot then turns on the last leg, the final approach
where clearance to land or for a touch-and-go is expected.

form of ‘Corridors’ are established and defined with radio navigational aids. Such
Corridors are known as Airways’ and have specified lower and upper limits. An airways
extends along a track starting from one navigational aid to another or through series of
navigational aids. The width or lateral dimension of airways vary from 8 km to 20 km (4
nm to 10 nm) on either side of the track. An airway in 10 nm wide over land and 20
nm wide over sea / oceans. This width depends on the accuracies of the navigationa
aids available along the route.

When different airways approach in the vicinity of one more major aerodromes, the
resultant terminal airspace is protected and control area is established. Such controlled
areas at the confluence of airways are called “Terminal Maneuvering Areas” (TMA).
TMAs are suitably lined with control zones of the aerodromes, located in terminal
airspace to facilitate the provision of approach control service for flights arriving at and
departing from these aerodromes.

29.
Standard phraseology is recommended in the interest of clarity and brevity. The
use of standard phrases does provide uniformity in transmission and makes your
transmission more readily understood by ground station operator and vice versa.
Correct procedure on the part of operators of radio telephony equipment is
necessary for the efficient exchange of communication and is particularly important
where lives and property are at stake. It is also essential for a sharing of “on the air”
time in the crowded radio spectrum.

111

AVIATION MEDICINE (AR-6)

G

C

K

Since flying an airplane demands that the pilot be alert and in full command of his
abilities and reasoning, it is only common sense to expect that an individual will ensure
that he is free of any conditions that would be detrimental to his alertness, his abilities
to make correct decisions, and his rapid reaction times before sitting himself behind the
wheel of an airplane. Certain physical conditions such as serious heart troubles,
epilepsy, uncontrolled diabetes and other medical problems that might cause sudden
incapacitations and serious forms of psychiatric illness associated with loss of insight or
contact with reality may preclude an individual from being judged medically fit to
apply for a license. Other problems such as acute infections are temporarily
disqualifying and will not affect the status of a pilot’s license. But they will affect his
immediate abilities to fly and he should seek his doctor’s advice before returning to the
cockpit of his airplane. In fact, any general discomfort, whether due to cold, indigestion,
nausea, worry, lack of sleep or any other bodily weakness, is not conducive to safe
flying. Excessive fatigue is perhaps the most insidious of these conditions, resulting in
inattentiveness, slow reactions and confused mental processes. Excessive fatigue
should be considered a reason for cancelling or postponing a flight.
HYPOXIA

N

C

C

The advance in aeronautical engineering in recent years has produced more versatile
airplanes capable of flying at very high altitudes. At such high altitudes, man is
susceptible to one of the most insidious physiological problems. Hypoxia comes on
without warning of any kind, supplementary oxygen must be available in any aircraft
that will be flown above 10,000 Feet. The general rule of oxygen above 10000 ASL by
day and above 5000 ASL by night is one the wise pilot will practice to avoid hazard of
these deliberating c o n d i t i o n s . Hypoxia can be defined as a lack of sufficient
oxygen in the body cells or tissues.

AI

R

The greatest concentration of air molecules is near to earth’s surface. There is
progressively less air and therefore less oxygen (per unit volume) as you ascend to
higher altitudes. Therefore each breath of air that you breathe at, for example, 15000
feet ASL has about half the amount of oxygen of a breath taken at sea level.
The most important fact to remember about Hypoxia is that the individual is unaware
that he is exhibiting symptoms of this condition. The brain centre that would warn him
of decreasing efficiency is the first to be affected and the pilot enjoys a misguided
sense of well-being. Neither is there any pain nor any other warning signs that tell him
that his alertness is deteriorating. The effects of Hypoxia progress from euphoria
(feeling of well-being) to reduced vision, confusions, inability to concentrate, impaired
judgment, and slowed reflexes to eventual loss of consciousness.
Effects on Vision at 5000 Feet
The retina of the eye is actually an outcropping of the brain and as such is more
dependent on an adequate supply of oxygen than any other part of the body. For this
reason, the first evidence of hypoxia occurs at 5000 feet in the form of diminished

112

night vision. Instruments
are misinterpreted.

and

maps

features

Above 10000 Feet
It is true that general physical fitness has some bearing on the exact altitude at which
the effects of Hypoxia will first effect a particular individual. Age, drinking habits, use of
drugs, lack of rest, etc, all the increase the susceptibility of the body to these conditions.
However, the average has been determined at 10000 feet.
At 10000 feet, there is a definite but undetectable Hypoxia. This altitude is the highest
level at which a pilot should consider himself efficient in judgment and ability. However,
conditions operation even at this altitudes for periods of more than, say 4 hours can
produce fatigue because of the reduced oxygen supply and a pilot should expect
deterioration in concentration, problem solving and efficiency.

C

K

At 14000 feet, lassitude and indifference are appreciable. There is dimming of vision,
tremor of hands, clouding of thought and memory and errors in judgment. Cyanosis
(blue discoloring of the finger nails) is first noticed.

G

At 16000 feet, a pilot becomes disoriented, is belligerent euphoric and completely
lacking in rational judgment. Control of the airplane can be easily lost.

C

Prevention of Hypoxic Hypoxia

C

At 18000 feet, primary shocks set in and the individual loses consciousness within
minutes. At higher altitudes, death may result after a prolonged period.

N

The only way to prevent Hypoxia is to take steps against it before its onset.
Remember the rule: Oxygen above 10000 feet by day and above 5000 feet at night.
HYPERVENTILATION

AI

R

Hyperventilation, or over breathing, is an increase in respiration that upsets the natural
balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the system, usually as a result of emotional
tension or anxiety. Under conditions of emotional stress, fright or pain, a person may
unconsciously increase his rate of breathing, thus expelling more carbon dioxide than is
being produced by muscular activity. The result is a deficiency of carbon dioxide in the
blood.
The most common symptoms are dizziness, tingling of the toes and fingers, hot and
cold sensations nausea and sleepiness. Unconsciousness may
result
is the
breathing rate is not regulated.
The remedy of hyperventilation is a conscious effort to slow down the rate of breathing
and to hold the breath intermittently to allow the carbon dioxide to build up to a normal
level. Some time, the proper balance of carbon dioxide can be more quickly restored
by breathing into a paper bag, that is, by re-breathing the expelled carbon dioxide.
The easily symptoms of hyperventilation and Hypoxia are similar and may be confused.
In fact, both conditions can occur at the same time. A pilot, flying at high altitude, may

113

think that he can counteract the effects of Hypoxia by taking more rapid breaths.
Hyperventilation does not help you get more oxygen. It only increases the emissions of
carbon dioxide. Hypoxia is unlikely to occur below 18000 feet ASL. Above 18000 feet,
if oxygen is available, take 3 or 4 deep breath of 100% oxygen. If the symptoms
persist, the problem is hyperventilation and should be treated as such.
DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS
Trapped Gases

C

EAR BLOCK

K

Because of the change in barometric pressure during ascent and the descent, gases
trapped in certain body cavities expand or contract. The inability to pass these gas
may cause abdominal pain, toothache or pain in ears or sinuses cavities. In some
cases, the pain may be so severe as to lead to incapacitation. The conditions caused
by changing barometric pressure are known as Dysbarisms: any physical damage that
results are called Barotraumas.

C

G

The ear is composed of three sections. The outer ear is the auditory canal and ends at
the eardrum. The middle ear is a cavity surrounded by bones of the scull. It houses the
organs of hearing and is filled with air. The Eustachian tube connects the middle ear to
the throat. The inner ear controls certain equilibrium senses and contains the cochlea, a
small organ that analyses sound vibrations.

N

C

During ascent and descent, air must escape or be replenished through the Eustachian
tube to equalize the pressure in the middle ear cavity with that of the atmosphere. If air
is trapped in the middle ear, the eardrum stretches to absorb the higher pressure. The
result is pain and sometime temporary deafness. Eardrum rupture is even possible.

AI

R

During climbs, there is little problem since excess
air escapes through the tube easily. However,
during Descends, when pressure in the middle ear
must be increased, the Eustachian tubes do not
open readily. The situation is aggravated if the
individual has a cold, and allergy or an infected
throat. Pilot and passengers must consciously
make an effort to swallow or yawn to stimulate the
muscular action of the tubes. Sometimes it is
advisable to use the Valsava technique, that is, to close the mouth, hold the nose and
blow gently.
FLYING FATIGUE
Fatigue is one of the most common psychological problems for air crew members and
will adversely affect individuals who are otherwise in good health. It has repeatedly
been citied as the casual factor in air plane accident. Fatigue degrades performance. A
tired pilot cannot carry out task as reliably and accurately as he should. He is irritable
and less alert, willing to accept lower standards of accuracy and performance. Fatigue
begins when the pilot begins a flight and increases with each hour in the air. As a result,

114

at the time of landing when reflexes and judgment should be keenest, the pilot is most
affected by the cumulative effects of fatigue. The biggest danger of fatigue is that and
individual may not recognize its effects. The onset of fatigue is accompanied by
numerous symptoms: deterioration in timing of movements, irritability and lack of
patience, a tendency to lock the attention on individual instruments rather than to
see the instrument panel as a whole, a tendency to become forgetful and ignorant of
relevant cues, a tendency to over control the air plane, and awareness of physical
discomforts, a loss of “sear of the pants” flying ability, a tendency to accept a wider
margin of error than normal.

K

Fatigue is caused by many things: lack of sleep, poor nutrition, stretch, prolonged and
repeated flights, air craft noise, eye strain, vibration, wide vibrations in temperature and
humidity, heavy work load and uncomfortable working conditions, boredom, monotony,
night flights, frustration from work and family.

C

Acute fatigue is easily treated by a meal and a good sleep. Chronically fatigue is more
serious and is caused by difficult or stressful work with inadequate rest and is often
aggravated disturbed circadian rhythms.

C

C

G

A sound physical condition, a healthy mental attitude, proper diet and adequate rest are
a pilots best weapons in fighting fatigue. On very long heights where the pilot and copilot share the piloting duties,
the advantage of taking 15-20 minutes pre planned
power nap shows beneficial results in improved performance. Conversation and
discussion help to keep us awake. Caffeine in moderation helps. Frequent small meals
to keep up the blood sugar relieve fatigue.

N

CONCLUSION

AI

R

The purpose of this lecture has been to make the aviators aware of the aeromedical
aspects of aviation, importance of oxygen content in the body /Hypoxia,
hyperventilation, flying fatigue etc. The most competent, knowledgeable and
experienced pilot continue to fly as long as he is medically fit. Maintaining physical
fitness is therefore of prime importance.
The person who is physically active, participating in a regular routine of exercise or
sports, will most likely have a healthy heart, lungs and not be overweight. Diet is
important not only to keep weight at an acceptable level, but also in the control of heart
disease. The case against smoking as a contributor to lungs disease and heart disease
is heavily documented. Protection of hearing by wearing earplugs has already been
mentioned as has the need to protect the eyes from undue eyestrain.

disturb the natural look of surroundings to catch the attention of rescue team.
LAND SURVIVAL

Jungle Survival
Jungle” is a term applied to natural forest of a particular land or region. It may be wet
tropical rain forest or dry open scrub country. Whatever the type of country, the
chances of survival after a successful landing depend on a number of factors, viz:
(a)
(b)

Previous knowledge.
Previous attention to personal clothing and kit.
Strict observance of a few simple rules.

Entering Jungle.
Prior to entering the jungle, whether by bailing out or by crash
landing, a mental note of the topography should be made. This should include features
like rivers, lakes, paddy fields, high ground, villages etc. The heading and bearing of
the aircraft and the position of the aircrew members, who may have bailed out, will help
orientation on the ground and location of crew members.
A set drill should be adhered to. This should include:-

Decide on a plan of action whether to remain with the aircraft or to trek factors which
would help in coming to a decision are as follows:

Whatever decisions is made, act without delay but not in haste. If remaining with the
aircraft attract attention. In addition to the emergency signalling gear, the fullest use
should be made of parachutes, dinghies, engine cowlings and broken glass as
reflecting surfaces. Ground signals to be effective should be 8` in length. If trekking,
select only those items of equipment which are absolutely essential to survival- do not

carry too much use full items are parachute packs from which shoes can be
improvised, shroud lines of parachutes which will be useful as fishing tackle, first aid
kit, personal pack and a hatchet / knife. A compass, maps, matches/ lighter, mirror for
signalling, pencil and note book will also be useful should you decide to take extra
clothing, socks should be given a priority.

Camping.
When camping chooses a site close to sources of water, food and
solid ground, taking whatever natural protection is available from the weather. Avoid
areas where there is dead and decaying vegetation. Prepare the site and light a fire as
soon as possible, both to drive away insects and also for cooking. When the fire has
produced a certain amount of ash, spread it in an unbroken line round the camp site to
prevent the intrusion of crawling insects. Lighting a fire is not as simple as Survival. It
would appear, and this becomes even more difficult when improvised methods
are used. It would pay aircrew to practice the several methods of lighting a fire, e.g. by
user of sun glass drill method, flint and steel etc.

Food.
This is seldom a problem in the jungle. It is important to know types of
edible fruits available in the particular area in which you operate. The food eaten by
monkey can be considered as generally fit for human consumption. The chief sources
of food are normally plant, fish and birds. Animal are potential source of food but are
not always easy to catch and kill.

in a city. The real dangers are:
(a)
Panic. This is by far the greatest hazards. Remember that the
obstacles you have to overcome are not so much natural ones as mental
ones. Other people have lived in such areas intentionally and by adjustments to
the demands of terrain, climate and environment. You too can survive.
(b)
Sun and Heat.
This may take the form of heat exhaustion or heat
stroke. The former is characterized by vomiting, and cramps and a feeling of

119

faints, and later by high temperature, dry skin and may be unconsciousness.
Keep yourself under shade and consume enough cold water.
(c)
Dysentery.
This is an inflammation of the bowel characterized by
pain in the abdomen and the passage of frequent loose stools with possibly
blood. Prevention is by cooking your food and purifying. If dysentery is suspected
solid food could be avoided. Large quantities of water should be taken to replace
lost body fluids.
(d)
Animals Leaches.
Leaches attach themselves to human body and
should be removed either by touching with salt or tobacco or burning with the
lighted end of a cigarette. They should not pull off as they leave their jaws in the
bite which will cause a festering sore.

(e)
Ticks.
These infect clothing and can be flicked off the skin. Be
careful in this case also as the head may stay in the skin and start infection. Use
an antiseptic on the bitten area.

C

G

(f)
Snakes.
These seldom attack man unless provoked. In case of snake
bite do not run about. Tie a tourniquet above the wound. Loosen the
tourniquet every 10 – 15 minutes for 2- 3 minutes. Squeeze out the blood from the
wound and wash with water.

N

C

(g)
Wild Animals.
Wild animals seldom interfere with man. While
travelling
through animal infested country, make as much noise as
possible. This will scare away big game. At night keep a fire burning and a
member of the party on watch. Bamboo thrown on a fire will burn with a loud noise
resemble gun shots sufficient to drive away animals.

R

Personal Hygiene. This most important and the following points must be borne in
mind:

AI

(a)
Care Of Feet.
Wash socks each day, wash your feet thoroughly,
keep your foot wear dry by keeping near the fire at night.
(b)
Sanitary Arrangements. Keep all sanitary arrangements clear of the
shelter or camp. Keep all waste matter covered with a layer of earth to prevent fly
breeding.
(c)
Blisters.
These should be treated immediately. The edge may be
pricked by a sterilized needle and the fluid pressed out. It should then be kept
clean and dry.

SEA SURVIVAL
Stay clear of airplane but in vicinity until it sinks. Search for missing men. Salvage
floating equipment and stow all items securely. Plug leaks in raft and bail it out. Check
condition of crew; give first aid if necessary. The sickness pills, if available. Get
emergency radio into operation. Directions are on equipment. Prepare other signalling
devices for instant use. Keep compass, watches, matches and lighters dry. Place in
water proof containers. If there is more than one raft, connect them with at least 25 feet

CONCLUSION

AI

Experience has shown that personnel equipped and trained in sound survival technique
will have substantially a better chance of evading capture and making good their
escape to friendly control. During the initial stages when the individual is isolated,
knowledge of correct survival techniques very often means, the difference between
remaining alive and free or submission to capture in order to obtain shelter, food and
medical care. If he is forced to travel to areas more suitable for extended survival or to
rendezvous points in friendly control, knowledge of how to survive while on the move
will be essential. If the distance to friendly territory is such that isolated personnel must
practice extended static survival in difficult terrain and adverse weather conditions,
knowledge of correct survival techniques will again be essential for success.

NAVIGATION – REQUIREMENTS OF NAV (NV-1)
Air Navigation is the art of guiding an aircraft through the air, so that it arrives at a
desired position at a pre-calculated time. Air Navigation differs from surface navigation
in several ways such as the aircraft travels at relatively high speeds, leaving less time
to calculate their position enroute.
Aircraft also normally cannot stop in mid-air to
ascertain their position at will.
REQUIREMENTS OF NAVIGATION
A number of times Pilot may be called upon to navigate the aircraft himself especially
in the aircraft types where no navigation is provided or in a single seat aircraft,
hence a thorough knowledge of the art of navigation is a must for a pilot.

C

K

Since the pilot has the primary duty of flying the aircraft, it would not be possible for him
to carry out the detailed task of a professional navigator in usage of plotting tables,
computers, charts etc. He however has to be skilled in map reading and mental DR in
order to navigate accurately.

G

Techniques used for air navigation in the air can be broadly classified into two groups.

C

C

(a)
Visual Flight Rules (VFR). The pilot largely navigates using dead
reckoning combined with Visual observations with reference to appropriate maps.
This may be supplemented by radio navigation aids.

N

(b)
Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). Under these rules the pilot will navigate
exclusively using instruments and radio nav aids such as beacons, or as directed
under radar control by a controlling air traffic controller.

AI

R

Before the flight the pilot must take pains to prepare and plan the flight
meticulously. For planning he will have to refer to the correct scale of maps, take
forecast winds into consideration, plan the cruising altitude, calculate ground speed and
time of flight and quantity of fuel required. He also would require to study the various
nav aids available at the departure, alternate and destination aerodromes, enroute
check points, their frequencies, time of availability etc.
Once in flight the pilot must stick to the plan otherwise getting lost is all too easy. This is
especially true if flying over featureless terrain or flying in the dark. This means that the
pilot must stick to the calculated headings, heights and speeds as accurately as
possible.
IMPORTANCE IN AVIATION
Apart from map reading and mental DR (mental dead – reckoning) the pilot
navigator should also be able to fly the aircraft accurately. Variation in speed, heights
and directions often results in unexpected gross errors and place the aircraft quite far

123

away from the desired track and time. A good pilot will plan a good flight meticulously
and fly that good plan.
Successful air navigation involves piloting an aircraft from place to place without getting
lost, breaking the laws applying to aircraft or endangering the safety of those on board
or on ground.
CONCLUSION

AI

R

N

C

C

G

C

K

Air Navigation is an important aspect of aviation and learning the skills involved in
good navigation techniques is an important aspect of flight training. Once these
techniques are learned on ground, they must be put to practice to gain experience
in pilot navigation technique as sorties from day to day will differ depending on
conditions, situations and environment.

Relief.
Mountains, hills, coast lines and other natural features are of
considerable interest to a pilot as they are valuable landmarks for navigation purpose or
are, sometimes pose dangerous barriers for flight. Relief is indicated on maps and
charts in one or more of five different ways:

Spot Heights and Depths.
These are shown
against places where the exact height above sea level
or depth below mean sea level has been measured.
On some maps, heights are recorded in feet. On other
maps the height is recorded in meters. One has to be
very particular to note the units of heights shown on
maps.

127

Contours and Form Lines. Contours are lines joining all places having the same
heights above a certain datum level. When these lines are shown approximately then
they are known as form lines. The closeness of the contours on a map shows the
steepness of any hill. Where the changes of height is rapid, the contours will be closer
than on slopes where they are spaced.
These are commonly used on maps to show relief. Layers of earth

between certain contours are coloured with the tint intensifying with successive increase
in height. Thus at a glance, a map will indicate major irregularities in the surface of the
country.
Hachures. These are short, tapering lines drawn on maps and they radiate from
peaks and high ground. They only serve to show slopes.

G

C

K

Hill Shading. This is produced by assuming that a bright light is shining across the
map sheet so that shadows are cast by all high ground on its lower side. The effect
is to give the map something of a stereoscopic appearance by optical illusion. These
shadows obliterate other details on the map and are not commonly used.
SYMBOLS USED IN MAPS

C

C

The details on topographical maps are shown by symbols. Some of which are pictorial
in nature, while others are given by a symbol which is accepted internationally. These
symbols are used to denote the details of a map and these are called as
conventional signs.

R

N

The signs are uniform on all maps but the colour used may vary on different scale
maps. Therefore, it is difficult to give a complete list of conventional signs used on
various maps. However, all maps have a list of signs marked on the side of map and
these should be studied before using the map for reading purposes.

AI

Knowing the amount of details to be expected on maps of different scales and given
knowledge of conventional signs by which that detail is indicated, the map reader is in a
position to appreciate the relative value of the feature seen on the ground. The
beginner is sometimes confused by the amount of detail confronting to his untrained
eye.
He must learn to distinguish the more significant features and to remain
undistracted by irrelevant back ground. The following may help to indicate the types of

SCALES OF MAPS
The scale is the ratio of a distance measured on the map to the corresponding distance
on the earth surface.
Scales on a map is represented commonly by (1)
representative fraction (2) graduated scale line or by (3) statement in words.
Most common maps used in aviation are ¼ million maps, ½ million maps and 1 million

Maps and charts are used for plotting and planning purposes in navigation. It is
essential to understand various scales, symbols and methods by which relief features
are represented in a map for effective planning and subsequent reading.
Before
execution of navigation sortie a pilot must thoroughly go through map preparation,
distance measurement and other calculations to be able to conclude the sortie
accurately.

Map Reading.
Fixing of position in the air by means of
map reading is vital. While many flights are made either
in clouds or above clouds and during the bad visibility
time, one makes a reference to the map to find out the
aircraft position. Ability to recognize on the map what is
seen from the aircraft and vice-versa is very valuable. A
navigator must be able to interpret at a glance the map or
chart. He must know the scale of the map, For map
reading, the most important factor is ORIENTATION OF
MAP or in other words, correct alignment of the map in the direction one is flying. By
doing this, he will be looking down his required track in the same direction as his
aircraft is heading. Once he has made sure of his position by map reading, the same
must be checked and double checked with other references. Jumping to a conclusion
at once, might prove wrong. Map reading differs with the time of light, as well as at
night and in bad visibility. Good map reading is attained by constant practice. The
first essential is to have a rough idea of the position of the aircraft and then he must be
able to anticipate ahead.

AI

It is very important ingredient of map reading exercises and unless
Anticipation.
one learns to expect major points and looks ahead for them map reading falls into
retrospect, thus making it impossible to make D.R. correction. Features or pin points
should always be cross checked with other features as jumping to conclusions may
prove disastrous.
.
Attention to ETAS.
Anticipation of features help the Pilot Navigator to keep a
check on time.
When ground speed is known, time to main features can be
calculated in advance and marked on the map. If there is a need to change in the
timing, calculations of ultimate change in ETA by fractional proportion are easily
possible. A good check on ground speed will automatically ensure correct ETA at
destination.

130

GROUND FEATURES

K

Map reading is always not an easy job. No map can look precisely like the earth itself.
Symbols are used to represent ground features and the selection of symbols and
features to show is not simple. Effort is made to represent those characteristics which
have the most distinctive appearance when seen from the air and avoid those which
would make the map a hopeless clutter.Cultural features and terrain features are two
general types of information appear on maps. Cultural features are manmade features
such as cities and towns, roads, railway, bridges, dams, race tracks, tower
obstructions etc. They are the easiest a beginner can use. Once properly identified
a cultural feature would provide a pin point fix more readily. Terrain features are like
rivers, mountain peaks, coastlines, lakes, islands etc which provide excellent check
points. Greater skill is required to use most of this information as colour shading is
used for terrain height, green colour reflecting low elevations and brown colour
representing higher elevations. Contour lines are also used to represent elevation.

(b)
Water Resources.
The line separating land from water, in any form
shows up more distinctly from air than does any other type of landmark. This is
true not only during day light but at night as well.

N

(c) Hills.
Usually, h i l l s a n d m o u n t a i n s are next in importance to w a t e r
features, though their value will vary with terrain. For example a peak rising 300
feet above the surrounding has little value in the Himalayas but great value in a
flat desert area.

AI

R

(d) Railways. Railways narrow down the position if their bearing is known, or
if the pattern is distinctive. Examples of pattern would be long straight stretches,
isolated functions, a radical change of direction etc.
(e) Roads.
Only broad arterial roads are likely to be of much of use, if they
are not camouflaged by forest, sand etc. Roads are indicated in red lines on
maps.
CONCLUSION
Map reading is an art and requires thorough practice by student pilot. Successful map
reading depends on correct interpretation of the symbols, anticipation and accurate
flying skills.

IMPORTANCE OF MET IN AVIATION (MET-1)
Meteorology is the study of the atmosphere and the weather processes that occur
in it. Since an aircraft is flown through a medium of the atmosphere, an aviator must
have adequate knowledge of meteorology and an appreciation of the effect of weather
on all aspects of flying.
IMPORTANCE OF MET IN AVIATION
Since meteorology is the science dealing with the study of atmosphere and an aircraft
is designed to fly through this medium, various weather processes and changes that
occur in the atmosphere has great significance for aviators.

C

G

C

K

Weather is global in nature and atmospheric changes occur on scales ranging from a
few centimeters to thousands of kilometers. To understand the larger scale
phenomena, it is necessary to observe the behavior of the atmosphere simultaneously
over large parts of the globe. This is possible only if the effort is one of international cooperation. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) provides the forum for such
co-operation. In matters concerning weather services for aviation, the WMO works in
close collaboration with the Met Division of the International civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO). India is a member of WMO and Meteorological Services in India are provided
by India Meteorological Department (Met D).

Meteorological forecasts and observations forms an integral
part of flight planning for safe execution of flight. Meteorological
occurrences like thunder storm, snow storm, heavy rains, low
visibility, high temperatures, dense fog, wind shear etc have
disastrous consequences to conduct of flight.
Hence it is
mandatory for aviators to be briefed about the likely
occurrences of any such phenomena which is likely to
endanger a safe flight and take avoidance action.
Meteorological briefing is undertaken to explain to the aircrew the
prevailing met conditions and expected conditions (forecast) over
the required areas of operation. It is called mass Met briefing
when briefing is done for a large body of People. In a mass met
briefing, the met officer gives the following information:(a)

Salient features observed on latest weather charts.

(b) Present state of weather at base and diversionary air fields with emphasis on
the aspects that are adverse for flying.

132

(c)
Forecast for base and diversionary airfields for the next 6-12 hours with
specific mention of weather warnings that may be in force and the likelihood of its
extension.
Met briefing always precedes the flight planning stage. Cooperation between met
section and aircrew are essential to maintain a high standard of accuracy in
forecasting weather.
APPLICATIONS IN AVIATION
Meteorological information is useful for aviation in the following ways:(a)
It enables a proper selection of site for an airfield and correct orientation of
runways.

C

K

(b)
It helps engineers to design aircraft suitably by giving them data of
pressure, wind, temperature and turbulence characteristics of the atmosphere at
various levels.

G

(c)
It assists in accurate planning and correct execution of take-off, climb,
cruise, descent/diversion, approach and landing of an aircraft.

C

C

The long term aspect of weather is climate. The physical state of atmosphere at a
given place and time is weather. Weather is described in terms of the instantaneous
values or short period mean values of the met element.
In climatology the
elements studied are the same as in Weather, but the period of averaging takes
several days, months, years or even centuries.

AI

R

N

Once these statistics are formulated it becomes relatively easier to forecast the weather
occurrences likely during the month and even during day. These forecasts are
important for aviators for planning purposes.
CONCLUSION

Knowledge of weather conditions likely to be encountered during a specific flight
enables the aviator to plan his flight with a view towards economy of fuel, operational
efficiency and flight safety.

VISIBILITY (MET-4)
Visibility is the term used to describe the transparency of the atmosphere. It is the
measure of maximum distance to which a person with normal vision can see an object
and recognize it as such.
IMPORTANCE OF VISIBILITY AND TYPES OF VISIBILITY
An aviator’s interest in visibility arises because he wants to know how far he will be
able to see various things like landmarks, targets, observations, beacon lights, other
aircraft, runways etc, while he is in flight or when he is about to make an approach and
landing.

C

K

Although all these questions cannot be fully answered by Met personnel on the ground,
met reports of visibility from ground section provide an aviator with vital information
which may prepare him mentally for a different landing or a diversion.

G

At some airfields, blind landing systems like ILS, GCA etc are provided for guidance
of aircraft for landing under conditions of poor visibility. Even these systems have their
limitations. A large of number of airfields in India does not have these aids. Thus, even
for experienced aviators, poor visibility still remains a serious hazard.

C

VISIBILITY OBSERVATIONS

C

The visibility reported by the met section has the following limitations:This will be

N

(a)
The report gives horizontal visibility at the ground level.
different from vertical and slant visibilities.

R

(b)
The report gives the lowest visibility after scanning all directions, though
visibility can be substantially different in different directions.

AI

(c)
Estimate of visibility depends on the illumination of the landmarks selected
for observation.
(d)
Visibility reported at night is actually an estimate of the equivalent day time
visibility.
TYPES OF VISIBILITY
Three types of visibility affecting aviation are horizontal visibility, slant visibility and
vertical visibility. Slant and vertical visibilities being reported from inflight. When a
shallow layer of haze or fog is covering an airfield, the horizontal ground visibility will be
poor. However an aviator flying over the airfield above the haze layer may be able to
see the airfield clearly. This can be deceptive since on approach for landing he would
suddenly encounter poor visibility and perhaps lose sight of runway.

142

CAUSES OF POOR VISIBILITY AND HAZARDS
Poor visibility of layers near the ground may be caused due to various
phenomena. Some of the main causes affecting visibilities is as follows:(a)
Dust Haze. Wide spread dust held in suspension for a number of days
due to persistent strong winds caused by steep pressure gradient especially over
desert and semi-arid regions. In this case the visibility gets affected for days
together reducing visibility below 5 km.

C
G

C

C

(c) DustStorm. Visibility in a
dust storm is less than 1000 mtrs
and this last for short durations.
However visibility remains poor
once the storm passes away due to
suspended dust and improves

Visibility forms an important aspect of safe conduct of flying. However with modern
avionics and nav aids this aspect is overcome to certain extent. But most airfields in
India does not support such modern nav aids and compounded by insufficient
avionics on board will stretch the capability of both aircraft and aircrew in case of
poor visibility conditions and it not careful can lead to disastrous consequences.

HUMIDITY AND CONDENSATION (MET-5)
Water vapour is very important constituent of the atmosphere so far as weather
processes are concerned. For studying these processes it is necessary to know the
actual water vapour content near the ground and also at various levels in the upper air.
HUMIDITY
Humidity is the general term used for denoting the water vapour content in air. It can be
expressed in several ways. The most common one used in meteorology is relative
humidity.

C

K

The atmosphere has capacity (greater at higher temperature and lesser at lower
temperature) of holding within it, invisible form of water vapour, that is, water in the
gaseous form. Thus when it holds the maximum quantity of water vapour it can at any
particular temperature, air is said to be saturated at that temperature. The water holding
capacity of a fixed volume of air at a specified temperature is fixed.

G

Relative humidity (RH). At a given temperature and pressure, air can hold only a
certain amount of water vapour and no more. When it holds this maximum quantity of
water vapour, it is said to have reached saturation.

C

C

Amount required to reach saturation

N

Relative humidity is expressed as as percentage. At the stage of saturation, the RH
is 100%.
VARIATION OF HUMIDITY

AI

R

RH of a sample of air increases when the temperature decreases and vice versa. As
long as there is no condensation taking place, absolute humidity is practically
unaffected by temperature. Absolute humidity remains more or less steady as
temperature does not decrease before DEW POINT which is the temperature at which
the water vapour actually present in the air becomes (due to fall in temperature)
sufficient to saturate air. In ascending air the relative humidity increases until it
becomes saturated after which condensation occurs.
CONDENSATION
The conversion of water vapour into liquid form
condensation. Few effects of condensation are as follows:

or

ice

form

is

called

(a)
Dew.
At a given temperature air can hold a certain quantity of
water vapour and more. The temperature at which saturation occurs is the dew
point temperature, because if the air is cooled below this temperature, the extra
water vapour settles down as dew ie- into small water droplets.

145

(b)
Airframe Icing.
Hoar frost. When the dew point is below the
freezing temperature the water condense into ice. Hoar frost occurs on an
airframe in the clear air, if its temperature is below the frost point of the ambient
air.

K

(c)
Formation of moist haze, mist and fogwhen air at the bottom of the atmosphere is cooled
to temperature below the dew point, condensation
occurs. When the cooling at the bottom is passed on
by frictional turbulence to a limited height, the
condensation product in the form of minute droplets
of water is held in suspension in the lower layer of atmosphere giving rise to
formation of fog, mist or haze depending on visibility.

C

(d)
Precipitation- general term used for drizzle, rain, shower, snow, sleet etc.
These are most common example of
condensation.

C

C

G

(e)
Contrails- They form due to moisture
content in the exhaust gas condensing into
visible streak of water or ice high in the
atmosphere.

N

CONCLUSION

AI

R

It is the water vapour present in the atmosphere that is largely responsible for trapping
much of the outgoing long wave radiation from the earth. It thus prevents the surface of
the earth and the lower layers of the atmosphere from getting chilled to a temperature
unbearably low. Water vapour is also responsible for many of the weather phenomena
which occur in the atmosphere i.e. rain, snow, thunderstorm, clouds and so on. While
some of them may be nuisance to flying on occasions, it is well to remember that the
very existence on earth may be threatened in their absence.

INTRODUCTION TO AERO ENGINES (AE-1)
An engine is a device where-in energy in one form is converted into another form.
Here the heat energy is converted into mechanical energy to produce required
propulsion. The propulsion is achieved by imparting acceleration to a certain mass of
gas as per Newton’s third law of motion.
BASIC THEORY

K

Aero-engines are machines which transform the potential energy contained in fuel
and air either into kinetic or mechanical energy. The gas energy is produced by the
combustion of an air-fuel mixture. The forward thrust is produced as per Newton’s third
law which states that ‘for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.’
The operating cycle (pressure / volume cycle) of a basic aero-engine is Brayton
cycle.

TYPES OF ENGINES (AE-2)
There are various types of engines in use today such as Heat engines, Electric motors,
Generators, Hydroelectric turbines and Wind mills. However, in the field of aviation,
heat engines are of great relevance. Heat engines are devices which convert heat
energy into mechanical energy.
PRINCIPLES OF PROPULSION
The propulsion of aircraft is achieved by imparting acceleration to a certain mass as per
Newton’s third law of motion. The relation between the force ‘F’ and the acceleration ‘a’
imparted to the mass ‘m’ is F = ma

K

There are two types of propulsion. They are as follows:-

G

C

(a)
Propulsion By Action.
It consists of rotating a propeller in the air so as
to create aerodynamic forces and to accelerate the mass of air. In this type of
propulsion, a great mass of air is expelled rearwards with a low increase of
speed. This is what a propeller does on the aircraft.

C

C

(b)
Propulsion By Reaction. In this case, the forward force is produced by
expelling a mass of gas with a certain speed. In this type of propulsion, a small
mass of air is expelled rearwards with a great acceleration. This is the principle of
je t propulsion. If ‘m’ is the mass flow of gas with ‘V1’ as inlet velocity and ‘V2’ as
outlet velocity, then forward force ‘F’ is given by ‘F’ = m (V2- V1)

The example is railway locomotive, where the
fuel (coal) is burnt outside the engine to
generate steam which is used to power the

JET ENGINES (AE-4)
Gas turbine engines are divided into two main classes. They are Turbo jet engine and
Turbo prop engine. Almost all the modern aircraft including military aircraft are powered
by this class of engines.
BASIC THEORY

C

C

G

The ambient air enters the engine through the air
intake. This air is then compressed by a multistage axial compressor. The combustion is
achieved in an annular chamber. Gases are
expelled at a high velocity, which creates the
required thrust.

K

The principle of operation of a jet engine is similar to a piston engine in that the
processes such as induction, compression,
ignition and exhaust are the same. The main
difference from piston engine is that in case of
a jet engine, the processes are continuous and
not intermittent which is the case with a piston
engine.

R

As explained, whatever the propulsion mode may be, the operating phases are similar.
In a gas turbine, these phases are achieved with the following elements:(a)
Air intake
(b)
Compressor
(c)

Turbine
(e)

AI

The thrust produced in a jet engine can be mathematically shown. If ‘m’ is the mass
flow of gas with ‘V1’ as inlet velocity and ‘V2’ as outlet velocity, then forward thrust
‘F’ is given by ‘F’ = m (V2-V1). A basic jet engine is shown below.

Turbo props are very efficient at speeds below 450 mph (390 knots; 725 kmph)
because jet velocity of propeller is relatively low. Also, compared to a turbo jet which

much lower ceiling. Turbo props are fitted on sub sonic aircraft.

AI

Trim Tabs. These are small control
surfaces connected to the trailing edge of
a larger control surface of aircraft,
used to control the trim of the
controls, i.e. to counteract aerodynamic
forces and stabilise the aircraft in a
particular desired attitude without the need
for the operator to constantly apply a
control force. This is done by adjusting the
angle of the tab relative to the larger
surface. Changing the setting of a trim
tab adjusts the neutral or resting position
of a control surface (such as an elevator or rudder). As the desired position of a
control surface changes (corresponding mainly to different speeds), an adjustable trim
tab will allow the operator to reduce the manual force required to maintain that
position—to zero, if used correctly. Thus the trim tab acts as a servo tab.
Air Brakes
Air brakes and Spoilers.
or speed brakes are a type of flight control
surface used on an aircraft to increase drag
or increase the angle of approach during
landing. Spoilers are designed to increase
drag while making little change to lift. Thus,
spoilers reduce the lift-to-drag ratio and
require a higher angle of attack to maintain
lift, resulting in a higher stall speed. Most
gliders are equipped with spoilers on the
wings in order to adjust their angle of descent during approach to landing.

158

C
G

Variable - Sweep Wing. A variable-sweep
w i n g , also known as"swing wing", is an
aeroplane wing that may be swept back and
then returned to its original position during
flight. It allows the aircraft's plan form to be
modified in flight, and is therefore an
example of a variable-geometry aircraft.

K

Slats. Slats are aerodynamic surfaces on
the leading edge of the wings of fixed- wing
aircraft which, when deployed, allow the
wing to operate at a higher angle of
attack. A higher coefficient of lift is
produced as a result of angle of attack and
speed, so by deploying slats an aircraft can
fly at slower speeds, or take off and land in
shorter distances. They are usually used
while landing or performing maneuvers
which take the aircraft close to the stall, but
are usually retracted in normal flight to
minimize drag.

N

C

C

Flaps. Flaps are hinged surfaces mounted
on the trailing edges of the wings of a fixedwing aircraft to reduce the speed at which an
aircraft can be safely flown and to increase
the angle of descent for landing. They shorten take-off and landing distances. Flaps do
this by lowering the stall speed and increasing the drag.

R

CONCLUSION

AI

Primary controls and secondary controls are the most essential control systems for all
types of aircraft. Several technology research and development efforts exist to integrate
the functions of flight control systems such as ailerons, elevators, elevons, flaps, and
flaperons into wings to perform the aerodynamic purpose with the advantages of
less mass, lower cost, reduced drag and inertia (for faster, stronger control
response).

aircraft with metal covering all surfaces. Some modern aircraft are constructed with

The fuselage is an aircraft's main body section that holds crew and passengers or
cargo. In single-engine aircraft it will usually contain an engine, although in some
amphibious aircraft, the single engine is mounted on a pylon attached to the fuselage
which in turn is used as a floating hull. The fuselage also serves to position control and
stabilization surfaces in specific relationships to lifting surfaces, required for aircraft
stability and maneuverability Since fuselage is the main attachment point for fire
wall,wing attachment points, landing gear attachment points, stringers, bulk
head/formers etc, its basic design and selection of materials play a major role in
deciding the strength of fuselage. Hence designers are extremely cautious to study the
aerodynamic effect on the given structure before going ahead with the type of structure
suitable for a particular aircraft.

AILERONS, ELEVATORS AND RUDDERS (AF-4)
The main control surfaces such as Aileron and Elevators of a fixed-wing aircraft are
attached to the airframe on hinges or tracks so that they may move and thereby deflect
the air stream passing over them. This redirection of the air stream generates an
unbalanced force to rotate the plane about the associated axis. The rudder is a
fundamental control surface in order to provide means of controlling yaw of an airplane
about its vertical axis.

Ailerons are mounted on the trailing edge of each
wing near the wingtips and move in opposite
directions. When the pilot moves the stick left, or turns
the wheel counter-clockwise, the left aileron goes up
and the right aileron goes down. A raised aileron
reduces lift on that wing and a lowered one increases
lift, so moving the stick left causes the left wing to drop
and the right wing to rise. This causes the aircraft to
roll to the left and begin to turn to the left. Centering
the stick returns the ailerons to neutral maintaining the bank angle. The aircraft will
continue to turn until opposite aileron motion returns the bank angle to zero to fly
straight.
ELEVATORS
An elevator is mounted on the trailing edge of the horizontal stabilizer on each side
of the fin in the tail, as shown in the figure above. They move up and down
together. When the pilot pulls the stick backward, the elevators go up. Pushing the stick
forward causes the elevators to go down. Raised elevators push down on the tail and
cause the nose to pitch up. This makes the wings fly at a higher angle of attack, which
generates more lift and more drag. Centering the stick returns the elevators to neutral
and stops the change of pitch. Many aircraft use a stabilator — a moveable horizontal
stabilizer — in place of an elevator. Some aircraft, such as an MD-80, use a servo tab
within the elevator surface to aerodynamically move the main surface into position. The

164

direction of travel of the control tab will thus be in a direction opposite to the main
control surface. It is for this reason that an MD-80 tail looks like it has a 'split' elevator
system.
RUDDER
A typical view of Rudder is shown below.

K

The rudder is a fundamental control surface, typically controlled bypedals rather than
at the stick. It is the primary means of controlling yaw-the rotation of an airplane
about its vertical axis. The rudder may also be called upon to counter-act the adverse
yaw produced by the roll-control surfaces.

N

C

G

C

On an aircraft, the rudder is a directional control surface. The rudder is usually
attached to the fin (or vertical stabilizer) which allows the pilot to control yaw about the
vertical axis, i.e. change the horizontal direction in which the nose is pointing. The
rudder's direction in aircraft has been manipulated with the movement of a pair of foot
pedals by the pilot.In practice, both aileron and rudder control input are used together
to turn an aircraft, the ailerons imparting roll, the rudder imparting yaw, and also
compensating for a phenomenon called adverse yaw. A rudder alone will turn a
conventional fixed wing aircraft, but much more slowly than if ailerons are also used in
conjunction. Use of rudder and ailerons together produces co-ordinated turns, in which
the longitudinal axis of the aircraft is in line with the arc of the turn, neither slipping
(under-ruddered), nor skidding (over-ruddered).
CONCLUSION

AI

12.
On an aircraft, an aileron is a hinged flight control surface usually attached to
the trailing edge of each wing of a fixed-wing aircraft. Ailerons are used in pairs to
control the aircraft in roll, or movement around the aircraft's longitudinal axis, which
normally results in a change in heading due to the tilting of the lift vector. Movement
around this axis is called 'rolling' or 'banking'. Elevators are flight control surfaces,
usually at the rear of an aircraft, which control the aircraft's orientation by changing the
pitch of the aircraft, and so also the angle of attack of the wing. In simplified terms, they
make the aircraft nose-up or nose-down. The elevators may be the only pitch control
surface present which is hinged to a tail plane or horizontal stabilizer. Both aileron and
elevator are important flight control surfaces and hence its design is very critical to
flight safety. The rudder is a fundamental control surface, typically controlled by
pedals. It is the primary means of controlling the rotation of an airplane about its
vertical axis. The rudder may also be called upon to counter-act the adverse yaw
produced by the roll- control surfaces.

LANDING GEAR (AF-5)
The undercarriage or landing gear in aviation is the structure that supports an aircraft
on the ground and allows it to taxi, take-off and land. Typically wheels are used, but
skids, skis, floats or a combination of these and other elements can be deployed,
depending on the surface.
TYPES OF LANDING GEAR
A typical landing gear is shown below.
A Landing gear can be classified
in to two types as follows:

C

G

C

K

(a)
Fixed Landing Gear.
A fixed gear always remains
extended
and
has
the
advantage
of
simplicity
combined
with
low
maintenance. It produces
parasitic drag in flight since it
is not flush with the surface.

N

C

(b)
Retractable Landing Gear.
To decrease drag in flight, some
undercarriages retract into the wings and/or fuselage with wheels flush against the
surface or concealed behind doors. This is called retractable gear. A retractable
gear is designed to streamline the airplane by allowing the landing gear to be
stowed inside the structure during cruising flight.

R

REQUIREMENTS OF LANDING GEAR

AI

The landing gear is the principal support of the airplane when parked, taxiing, taking off,
or landing. The most common type of landing gear consists of wheels, but airplanes
can also be equipped with floats for water operations, or skis for landing on snow.
The landing gear consists of three wheels—two main wheels and a third wheel
positioned either at the front or rear of the airplane. Landing gear with a rear mounted
wheel is called conventional landing gear. Airplanes with conventional landing gear are
sometimes referred to as tail wheel airplanes. When the third wheel is located on the
nose, it is called a nose wheel, and the design is referred to as a tricycle gear.
A steerable nose wheel or tail wheel permits the airplane to be controlled throughout all
operations while on the ground. Most aircraft are steered by moving the rudder pedals,
whether nose wheel or tail wheel. Additionally, some aircraft are steered by differential
braking.The Landing gear takes up the load of the aircraft while landing thereby prevent
structural damage to the airframe.

166

A tricycle gear airplane has three advantages:
(a)
It allows more forceful application of the brakes during landings at high
speeds without causing the aircraft to nose over.
(b)
It permits better forward visibility for the pilot during takeoff, landing, and
taxing.
(c)
It tends to prevent ground looping (swerving) by providing more directional
stability during ground operation since the aircraft’s center of gravity (CG) is
forward of the main wheels. The forward CG keeps the airplane moving forward
in a straight line rather than ground looping.

K

The landing gear forms the principal support of an aircraft on the surface. The most
common type of landing gear consists of wheels, but aircraft can also be equipped with
floats for water operations or skis for landing on snow. Since it is the primary load
bearing member, its design is very crucial from the flight safety point of view.

BASIC FLIGHT INSTRUMENTS (IN-1)
The best medium for flying an aircraft is the natural horizon. It is the place where the
earth and the sky seem to meet. But during cloudy conditions and at night, the horizon
is not visible. During such occasions, the instruments of an aircraft play a very vital role
in aiding the pilot to fly the aircraft safely. As flying involves the third dimension,
instruments become very important. The instruments also give out the health of the
engine and re-assure the pilot that all vital parameters of flying are within the prescribed
limits.
AIR SPEED INDICATOR

K

The airspeed indicator is an instrument used in an aircraft to display the craft's airspeed
to the pilot.

C

The principle of an Air Speed Indicator is the measurement of two pressures called
static and pitot pressures.

AI

R

N

C

C

G

If an open ended tube is moved through the air, pressure
will be exerted at the closed end of the tube. This
pressure has two components- static and the dynamic.
The static pressure is due to the pressure exerted by
the atmosphere and the dynamic is due to the
movement of the tube through the air. The total pressure
is known as pitot pressure. the dynamic pressure is
indicated in terms of speed of the aircraft. The
dynamic pressure is calculated as: Dynamic = Pitot –
Static

168

Internal Mechanism of An Airspeed Indicator
This instrument uses an open ended capsule fixed inside an airtight case. The open
end is connected to pitot pressure. Static pressure is fed inside the case. The static
pressure remaining constant in the entire case, the variation is only in the pitot pressure
due to the movement of the aircraft in air. The capsule accordingly expands or
contracts and this variation is calibrated in terms of speed.
ALTIMETER
An altimeter is an instrument used to measure the altitude of an object above a fixed
level usually the sea level. The altimeter shows the aircraft's altitude above mean sealevel. Altitude can be determined based on the measurement of atmospheric pressure.

C

K

The atmosphere has weight and this weight exerts pressure. This is known as static
pressure. This pressure reduces with height at the rate of 1 millibar / hectapascal per
30 feet approximately.

C

C

G

An aneroid barometer is used to measure the atmospheric pressure. An aircraft
altimeter is simply an aneroid barometer adapted to use in aircraft calibrated to read the
atmospheric pressure in terms of height. This is done by measuring the difference
between the pressure in a stack of aneroid capsules inside the altimeter and
the atmospheric pressure obtained through the static system. As the aircraft ascends,
the capsules expand and the static pressure drops,
causing the altimeter to indicate a higher altitude.
The opposite effect occurs when descending.

AI

R

N

The altimeter has two or three capsules each having
vacuum or partial vacuum in them. They are stacked
together with one end fixed firmly down. There are
three pointers to indicate height in 100s ,1000s and
10,000s feet.
The whole assembly is encased in a container having
an inlet for the static pressure but otherwise is airtight.
The movement of the capsules in response to the variation in the pressure due to
variation of height is transmitted to the pointers which indicate the height on the dial.

ARTIFICIAL HORIZON

169

The artificial horizon shows the aircraft's attitude relative to the horizon. From this,
the pilot can tell whether the wings are level and if the aircraft nose is pointing
above or below the horizon. This is a primary instrument for instrument flight and is
useful in conditions of poor visibility.
An artificial horizon is an instrument used in an
aircraft to inform the pilot of the orientation of the
aircraft relative to earth. It indicates pitch (fore and
aft tilt) and bank or roll (side to side tilt).

C

G

(a)
The centre horizon bar separating the
two halves of the display, with the top half
usually blue in color to represent sky and the
bottom half usually dark to represent earth.

K

The essential components of the indicator are
“miniature wings", horizontal lines
with a dot between them representing the actual
wings and nose of the aircraft:-

N

C

C

(b)
Degree marks representing the
bank angle. They run along the rim of the
dial. On a typical indicator, the first 3
marks on both sides of the center mark
are10 degrees apart. The next is 60
degrees and the mark in the middle of the
dial is 90 degrees.

AI

R

If the symbolic aircraft dot is above the horizon
line (blue background) the aircraft is nose up. If
the symbolic aircraft dot is below the horizon
line (brown background) the aircraft is nose
down. it is the horizon that moves up and down and turns, while the symbolic aircraft is
fixed relative to the rest of the instrument panel.
Artificial Horizon uses a vertical axis earth gyroscope having freedom in all three planes
to indicate the aircraft’s attitude in pitch and roll. The gyroscope is geared to a display
simultaneously displaying pitch and bank. The display is coloured to indicate the
horizon as the division between the two coloured segments, blue for sky and brown for
ground.
CONCLUSION
During this period, the basic three instruments have been covered to understand their
use and functioning. One must remember that the instruments play a very vital part in
helping the pilot to fly an aircraft. The height above the mean sea level, the condition of
flight and the speed of the aircraft can thus be known by the pilot by monitoring the
instruments.

INTRODUCTION TO RADARS: (IN-2)
Radar was secretly developed by several nations before and during World War II. The
term RADAR was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy as an acronym for Radio
Detection and Ranging. The term radar has since entered English and other languages
as the common noun radar, losing all capitalization.
The modern uses of radar are highly diverse, including air traffic control, radar
astronomy, air-defence systems, antimissile systems; marine radars to locate
landmarks and other ships; aircraft anti-collision systems; ocean surveillance systems,
outer space surveillance systems; meteorological precipitation monitoring; and guided
missile target locating systems.

K

RADAR

Radar is a machine that uses radio waves to find other objects such as aircraft, ships,
and rain.The basic parts of radar are:-

C

C

G

(a)
The transmitter creates the radio waves.
(b)
The antenna directs the radio waves.
(c)
The receiver measures the waves which are bounced back by the object
that the radar is trying to find.
(d)
By doing this, the radar can find what place the
object is at.

AI

R

N

Radar is an object detection system which uses radio waves
to determine the range, altitude, direction, or speed of
objects. It can be used to detect aircraft, ships, spacecraft,
guided missiles, motor vehicles, weather formations, and
terrain. The radar dish or antenna transmits pulses of radio
waves which bounce off any object in their path. The object returns a tiny part of the
wave's energy to a dish or antenna which is usually located at the same site as the
transmitter.
A radar system has a transmitter that emits radio waves called
radar signals in predetermined directions. When these come into
contact with an object they are usually reflected or scattered in
many directions. Radar signals are reflected especially well by
materials of considerable electrical conductivity—especially by
most metals, by seawater and by wet lands. The radar signals
that are reflected back towards the transmitter are the desirable
ones that make radar work.
In aviation, aircraft are equipped with radar devices that warn of obstacles in or
approaching their path and give accurate altitude readings.

171

TYPES OF RADARS
PRIMARY RADAR
This radar uses the principle of pulse technique to determine
range and bearing of an object. Working on echo and search light
principle, a transmitter transmits pulses. All objects in the path of
the pulses will reflect and scatter this energy. Some of the reflected
energy reaches the receiver. The reflected energy is processed to
give the required information. In this radar, the object’s cooperation
is not required in the entire process.
SECONDARY RADAR

G

C

K

In this system, a transmitter transmits a group of pulses. An
aerial in the path of the pulses receives the signals and
passes it to receiver. If the pulses are identified, then the
transmitter gives out a reply. In this radar active cooperation of
the other object is also required.
CONTINUOUS WAVE RADAR

R

N

C

C

In this type of radar, both the transmission and the reception
take place continuously. This requires set of two aerials,
one for transmission and one for reception.

CONCLUSION

AI

Thus it is seen that radar is used for locating objects by sending signals and receiving
reflected signals. There are different kinds of radars. This equipment is used in various
fields and especially so in the military field.

INSTRUMENT BATTERY TEST (IN-3)
Pilot aptitude battery test is administered once in a life time. It consists of two parts. The
instrument battery test (INSB) and the machine test. Only the cadets who pass the
INSB are then give an opportunity to give the machine test. This test is basically
a test of understanding the readings of instruments, interpreting them and answering
the multiple choice questions.

C

K

A typical simple aircraft has a nose, a tail or exhaust, a right wing and a left wing. It
also has tail planes and a fin. Irrespective of the condition of flight and how one view
the aircraft, the right wing is always referred to as right wing and the left as left
wing. The nose is coloured white and the tail or exhaust is depicted by black colour.
The reference of knowing whether an aircraft is climbing or descending is based on the
position of the nose with respect to the horizon. If the nose is above the horizon, the a/c
is climbing and it is descending when the nose is below the horizon. The a/c has a right
bank if the right wing is below the horizon and a left bank when the left wing is below
the horizon.

C

C

G

Instruments are required to fly an aircraft as you have already learnt in the first year. So
this test of INSB is basically to know how to read and interpret the instruments. The first
part of this test consists of reading six instruments and correlating it with five statements
out of which only one is correct. The second part of the INSB consists of reading two
instruments compass and A/H AND interpreting the correct position of an a/c from a
set of five pictures given.

N

Part -I has only 15 questions numbered from 1-15 to be answered in 12 minutes. The
part-II has 60 questions numbered from 16 to 75 to be answered in 20 minutes. The
correct method of answering is by marking a cross,’X’, on the appropriate answer.

R

ALTIMETER

AI

A simple instrument which gives the altitude of aircraft in feet. The longer needle gives
the altitude in hundreds of feet whereas the shorter needle gives the altitude in
thousands of feet. The shorter needle jumps from one number to the next after the
longer needle has completed one full revolution of 1000 feet. Unlike a watch the shorter
needle does not have an intermediary position like that of an hour hand. The maximum
altitude is only up to 9990 feet. Each division on the dial marks 20 feet. The position
between two marks is to be interpreted as 10 feet.
ARTIFICIAL HORIZON
This instrument gives the bank angle, direction of bank, and the aircraft position viz,
climbing descending, right wing low or left wing low. The dial has one stationary model
of an aircraft which is going into the dial. That means we are able to see the tail of
a/c. the wing towards our right is right wing and vice versa. There is one moving bar
which is the artificial horizon bar. If the nose of the a/c is above the horizon bar, the

173

a/c is in a climbing position and if below then it is in descending position. Whether the
a/c is actually climbing or descending is given by another instrument called the rate of
climb and descend indicator. If the right wing is below the horizon, the a/c is flying with
right wing low with a certain bank. This bank angle is read out from the top part of the
dial. A triangular mark will give the bank angle in a direction opposite to that of the
bank. If the a/c is banking to the right, then the marker will indicate towards the left.
Thus this instrument gives out the condition of flight. Whether A/c climbing descending
or maintaining straight and level flight. Whether a/c has right or left wing low, the
bank angle and also the instrument gives out a combination of these positions.
This instrument has to be read in conjunction with ROCI and turn and bank indicator to
actually know whether the a/c is climbing/descending or turning right/left.

The dial has markings of N, E, S, W directions. These are the cardinal headings north
east south and west. At every 45* there is one marking giving the inter-cardinal
headings north east, southeast, southwest and North West. There is one needle reading
the direction. If the needle is in the arc between north and north east the direction is
read as north of north east. The needle being between north east and east is
interpreted as east of north east. Similarly other directions are interpreted.

C

The dial has markings of speed in MPH or miles per hour. Each marking represents 10
mph. 40, 80, 120, etc are marked up to 240 mph. The least count is of 5 mph. There is
a needle from which the readings are interpreted.

N

CONCLUSION

R

The understanding of the instruments and their readings would again be taught at the
AFSBs before commencement of the test. This exposure at NCC will enable the cadets
to imbibe the instructions better at the PABT centre. The first part of the INSB is to be
continued in the next period where three more instruments will be covered.

HISTORY OF AEROMODELLING (AM-1)

your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been, and there you will always
long to return."

Aeromodelling is one of the finest hobbies, which is very popular worldwide
among people of all ages and professions. It has often been the starting point of many
pilot and aero-nautical engineer. The aims of including aeromodelling in the NCC
curriculum are to increase the air mindedness in the youth of our country. If taken on
the right lines, it can be extremely thrilling for all, as by constructing the models by
one’s own hands, will make understanding of various principles of flight and problems
of construction etc., very easy, apart from providing great personal satisfaction to the

The history of aeromodelling goes back much further than the history of real aircraft.
The successful experiments, however, started in the nineteenth century. Dr. Thomas
Young was the first person to discover
the ‘lifting’ property of a cambered
surface in comparison to the flat surface.
Sir George Caley built a helicopter
model, based on a design of Leonardoda-vinci, in 1796. Another aeromodelling
genius was John String fellow, who built,
in 1842, a small spring ‘Operated model’,
followed by a number of different and
bigger models, powered by 2-stroke as
well as steam engines. Another great
name
amongst
the
pioneers of
aeromodelling is of Alphones Penand,
who invented models fitted with tail surfaces and wings with dihedral angles. This gave
substantial stability of flight to aero models, which till this time had lasted for very short
duration. Next came energy, enthusiasm and tenacity of purpose which earned him the
distinction of being the most active champion of glider flying. After this, came the era of
miniature petrol-driven engines. In 1878, Professor Langley builds a petrol driven model
called ‘Aerodrome No.5’. This revolutionalised the concept of aeromodelling, as there
was now an ideal power plant small enough for the requirement, available to
the enthusiasts. Hundreds of varieties of petrol models were subsequently built.
Later, these gave ways to more powerful diesel engines, which are in use even today.

hobby and is usually cluttered up with complicated calculations and formulae, it need
not necessarily discourage the beginners and the non-technical persons, as they can
still derive immense pleasure and satisfaction from this hobby. Aeromodelling is
becoming increasingly popular all over the country especially amongst the NCC Air wing

The necessity of choosing a large field for flying the aero models is obvious. However,
trees and wooded areas are the greatest hazards for the aeromodeller. Trees cause air
pockets and down-draughts and often ‘suck’ the model into their branches.

edge of the wing, and is gently launched
into wind slightly nose down attitude. If the
model is set properly and trimmed
correctly, it will glide forward gracefully
and will land on wheels. Use plasticine or
lead weight at the nose and tail for balance
as required.

K

First check the model for correction of
alignment. The wing and tail must be
checked from the front and rear for setting
and must not be warped or out of plane.
Testing is carried out during mid-day
when there is little or no wind. The model
is held on the point of balance i.e.
approximately 1/3 rd back from leading

Power flight is not advisable till the gliding test is carried out successfully. For trail flight,
a small amount of fuel is put into the fuel tank and the engine started by rotating the
propeller. And the model launched gently the model should fly short distance and land
perfectly.

SAFETY CODE
GENERAL

AI

(a)
I will not fly my model aircraft in competition or in the presence of
spectators until it has been proven to be airworthy by having been previously
successfully flight tested.
(b)
I will not fly my model higher than approximately 400 feet within 3 miles of
an airport without notifying the airport operator. I will give right of way to, and avoid
flying in the proximity of full scale aircraft. Where necessary an observer shall be
utilized to supervise flying to avoid having models fly in the proximity of full scale
aircraft.
(c)
Where established, I will abide by the safety rules for the flying site I use,
and I will not willfully and deliberately fly my models in a careless, reckless, and/or
dangerous manner.

RADIO CONTROL

C

C

(a)
I will have completed a successful radio equipment ground range check
before the first flight of a new or repaired model.

N

(b)
I will not fly my model aircraft in the presence of spectators until I become a
qualified flyer, unless assisted by an experienced helper.

AI

R

(c)
I will perform my initial turn after takeoff away from the pit, spectator, and
parking areas, and I will not thereafter perform maneuvers, flights of any sort, or
landing approaches over a pit, spectator, or parking area.

CONTROL LINE

183

(a)
I will subject my complete control system (including safety thong,
where applicable) to an inspection and pull test prior to flying.
(b)

I will assure that my flying area is safety clear of all utility wires or poles.

(c)
I will a s s u r e that my flying area is safely clear of all non-essential
participants and spectators before permitting my engine to be started.
